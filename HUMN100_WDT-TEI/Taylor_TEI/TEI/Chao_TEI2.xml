               <ab> Absolutely not; absolutely not. <persName ref="#neilan_marshall"
                     >Marshall</persName> is the typification of the happy-go-lucky Irish spirit and
                  tempera­ment. He does perfectly terrible things to everybody, but everybody loves
                  him. They are always glad to see him again. As to harboring any deep-seated
                  malice, I don't believe he is capable of it. </ab>

                  when are we going all around the world on our honey-moon?" exactly in the same

                  While I have known him a great many years, well, I will say I have known him
                  several years, he is the type who flits back and forth, you know. - When you
                  really think you know him he turns to something else, and I don't know, so I have
                  never permitted myself to form any conclusions on his character; I don't know
                  whether he has ever taken me seriously or not. I always treated him more or less
