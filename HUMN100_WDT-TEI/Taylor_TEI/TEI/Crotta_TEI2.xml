               <ab>Yes, this was <date>Thursday night</date> after the murder. I said, <quote>"Please tell <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Mickey</persName> not to
                  drive that <objectName type="vehicle">green car</objectName> so reckless; I am so afraid that he, too, will fall into
                  trouble.</quote> And she thanked me and said, <quote>"I will tell him. That is just exactly what
                  I have been thinking lately myself, and I want to see you soon, <persName ref="#minter_mary">Mary</persName>."</quote> With that I
                  thought no more about it. In fact, I didn't even think <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName> would
                  call me. He had not called me in three weeks or more. 1 thought no more about it and
                  I was surprised the next day to learn -- yes, <date>Friday</date> -- that he had tried to get
                  me at <time>five-thirty</time>. My <persName>sister</persName> was at our <placeName>old home</placeName> where there is a <objectName type="furniture">telephone</objectName>. The
                  <placeName>present home</placeName> has no <objectName type="furniture">telephone</objectName>, and when he happened to call there she was
                  there.</ab>

               <ab><date>Friday</date>; and he said he was very anxious to see me. She knew I had left and was
                  driving with <persName ref="#scarborough_george">George Scarborough</persName>, and she said she didn't know what time I would be
                  back. He said well, he wanted me to come to see him <time>before ten o'clock</time>, but <time>after
                  ten o'clock</time> he would be on location. He didn't say the <placeName>Salt Lake Station</placeName>, but he
                  was very anxious to get hold of me <time>before ten o'clock</time>. I came in <time>after ten</time> and
                  they all told me l had better call <persName ref="#neilman_marshall">Marshall</persName>; he seemed very anxious to get hold of
                  me. I didn't· know where to call him; I thought possibly he would come to the
                  <placeName>house</placeName>. I waited for him awhile and he didn't come, and finally <persName>grand­mother</persName> said,
                  <quote> "<persName ref="#minter_mary">Dearie</persName>, If I were you I would call him up or at least call <persName>his mother</persName> and find
                  out where he is."</quote> I called the <placeName>studio</placeName> and the <persName>night watchman</persName> immediately said, <quote>"<persName ref="#neilman_marshall">Mr
                  Neilan</persName> is not here; is this <persName ref="#minter_mary">Miss Minter</persName>?"</quote> I said, <quote>"Yes."</quote> <date>Friday</date> And he said, <quote>"<persName ref="#neilman_marshall">Mr

                  runabout. He was very hard at work and had been <time>all night</time>, it seemed he had
                  been working <time>all night</time> tor <date>four nights past</date>. They were all just dead tired.
                  Night and day they had been working. He finished about <time>two-thirty</time>, and then there
                  were several in the party, <persName ref="#swanson_gloria">Gloria Swanson</persName>, <persName ref="#pickford_jack">Jack Pickford</persName>, <persName ref="#urson_frank">Frank Urson</persName> --<persName ref="#urson_frank"> Mr Frank

                  went to <placeName>his mother's home</placeName> where he lives with his mother and we tried to make <objectName type="food_drink">eggs</objectName>
                  and things. It was very amusing; we only had four <objectName type="food_drink">eggs</objectName>, and I tried to fry two of
                  them and ruined the things, adn we didn't have enough to go around and we made so
                  much noise his mother, who was ill upstairs, told us we must behave ourselves.

                  them to me in my interest, but they made me very furious at the time, and we left
