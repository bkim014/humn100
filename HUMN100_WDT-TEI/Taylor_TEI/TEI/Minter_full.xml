                  months, and I just got to thinking about it and I decided I couldn't stand it any
                  longer. I was going to go up and tell him "goodbye. I got up and dressed, went
                  down to my grandmother's room and I said, "Mama, I am going over to say 'goodbye'
                  to Mr Taylor," and she advised me not to do it. She said it was too late: "Do you
                  know it is nearly twelve o'clock?" she said. I said, "Yes, sure, but I just must
                  do so," I said, "I realize that this is not the usual thing and I have never been
                  there so late, but I must do so, Mama. I am going to give him a letter in whioh I
                  have told him 'goodbye,"' She said, "All right, then, if you must. I would get up
                  and go with you, but I don't feel well enough," Mama often accompanied me on my
                  trips, which were not very many during the entire time that i knew him. So I went
                  over there and arrived at five minutes to twelve, I am strange about that, I am
                  rather queer about that, I think of the time; every time I was with him I would
                  say, "Well, this time yesterday I didn't see him and today I am with him," and
                  things like that. So I arrived at five minutes to twelve and left at twenty
                  minutes to one, and-- Do you wish me to tell you all that transpired?</ab>

               <ab> I had always known that this was just an exquisite chapter in my life that must
                  necessarily be a brief one: I couldn't bear to part with it; it was just a
                  beautiful thing that seldom occurs in the <date when-iso="1922">world today</date>
                  as I see it, as it is forced upon me. It as simply a beautiful white flame; I met
                  him; I had always been a reserved, very retiring young girl, and he was the first
                  man and the only man who ever embodied all the glories of manhood in one private
                  body. He represented that to me. He never by look, by word or by deed gave me any
                  reason to doubt any of my ideals that were placed in him absolutely. At the time
                  our love first formulated he said to me, <quote>"Mary, this is not right. You are
                     May and I am December, and this is not right. I know it is best that we must
                     part."</quote> This was at the very beginning of it, and I said, <quote>"Of
                     course, I don't want to do any immodest or bold thing; I couldn't try to
                     withhold a person's love for me who didn't care for me."" I said, "I know that
                     you are many years older than I, but I couldn't love anybody as I love you. I
                     simply love you."</quote> And we did try to part, We tried it again and again,
                  and then he would beoome ill. At one time I had almost resolved to see him no
                  more, and he was taken ill and nobody else cared, [page 6] really cared whether he
                  ate his dinner or whether he dressed warm1y enough, whether he took care of
                  himself, and I couldn't bear for him to suffer. It was not only a love of
                  sweetheart, but I wanted to be his nurse. I wanted to hold his head when it was
                  aching. I wanted him to tell me his mental troubles, his heart troubles, and let
                  me soothe them away for him as I would for a little child. I forgot the man's age;
                  it meant nothing to me. The only thing I wanted was to serve him as I would have
                  served the Lord or a little child, and then it just passed away; for months at a
                  time I wouldn't see him and I didn't know why. Finally, I decided there was no
                  use; it must come to an end and I went there on the night of the 23d to give him
                     <objectName>this letter</objectName> telling him "goodbye." I had reason to
                  believe, in the awful vernacular of the day, that it was over anyway, but I went
                  there to say "goodbye" myself. He said,<quote> "It is rather late, isn't it,
                     Mary?"</quote> when he opened the door. I said, <quote>"Yes, but don't you
                     realize that I had to come to see you? You know <persName ref="#shelby_charlotte">Mama</persName> has
                     been sick for three months and you have been ill and I have been frightfully
                     worried and you haven't even had the kindness to call me to tell me that you
                     were i11 and that I must not expect to see you to tell mo that things are all
                     right."</quote></ab>
               <ab> I said, <quote>"I don't care if you don't wish to see me, because it hurts me,
                     but it wouldn't have hurt one-millionth as much if you had just explained to me
                     and not leave me in the dark."</quote> He said, <quote>"Mary I couldn't help
                     it; I couldn't help it and I can't explain it to you."</quote></ab>
               <ab> Oh, I don't know! I have told this thing so many times, Mr Doran, that the words
                  just - I can't tell it even as it is; I can't even express it to you as it really
                  is. There is so much more to it.</ab>

                  me.</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MR DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>I read in the <objectName>paper</objectName> where you had been engaged to some
                  other man.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>To <persName ref="#dickson_thomas">Mr Dickson</persName>. That is not entirely true.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>What is his first name?</ab>

               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>Yes, <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall Neilan</persName>. Didn't I read in the
                     <objectName>papers</objectName> that you had been engaged to him and the
                  engagement had been broken off?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>That is not true. <persName ref="#dickson_thomas">Mr Dickson</persName> is the only one to whom I have
                  been even remotely engaged, and that was a freak of despondency.</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>

               <ab>Had you been going with <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall Neilan</persName> during, say the last

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>Yes; he had been to see me; I had been out with him; I am not sure whether it was
                     <time>within the thirty days</time> or not, but in <time>the last two
                     months</time>, yes sir; but going with him no more than I had for
                     <time>years</time> off and on. <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Mr Neilan's</persName> traits [page 9]
                  are well known; he comes to see you, and we are always glad to receive him, but we
                  never know how long he is going to stay with us or how long he was going to stay
                  with this one or that one. He flits here and there like a swallow. We are all
                  charmed with his personality, but don't take him seriously.</ab>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>Do you recall approximately when it was?</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab><time>About two months ago.</time></ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>That would take it to <date>December 1st</date>, approximately or <date>in the
                     middle of December</date>?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>Well, I think it was after that, Yes -- No, let me see, <date>December 1st</date>
                  -- I wish I could tell you.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>With reference to this <date>December 23d</date> that you called on
                     <persName ref="#taylor_william">Taylor</persName>, when was it?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>It as <time>before the <date>1st of December</date></time>, I think.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>Q. <time>Before the <date>1st of December</date></time>?</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>Yes; about <date>the last of November</date>.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>And you, of course, rejected im, I suppose?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>Yes; that is, I didn't exactly say, <quote>"No, I will not marry you."</quote> I
                  didn't take him seriously. I joked with him at the time.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>You never know. I couldn't say whether ee was serious or not. I thought possibly
                  he was joking, or had a few <objectName>cocktails</objectName>.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>How many times after that did he mention the subject to you?</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>He didn't mention the subject. <quote>"May I marry you"</quote> again; he didn't
                  say that, but he has been on very friendly terms with me and then suddenly go away
                  to <placeName>San Francisco</placeName>. and I wouldn't hear from him and I would
                  remark, <quote>"Isn't that just like <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName>?"</quote> and
                  thought no more of it.</ab>

               <ab> Well, but along toward the last thirty days prior to
                     <persName ref="#taylor_william">Taylor's</persName> death, he seemed to be quite devoted to you, did
                  he not? </ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker> MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab> No; I can't really say that he did. As for being with him, wasn't with him very
                  much. </ab>

               <speaker> MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab> Oh, no; No, I can't say that. He was not jealous of me. He is the least jealous
                  man I ever met. He takes life too much -- </ab>

               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab> Yes, we have discussed him many times; he loved him. <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall

            <sp>

               <ab> When was that?</ab>

               <ab>
                  <date>Last Friday night</date>; whereupon we had a severe

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN: </speaker>
               <ab> Did he ever say anything like that to you before the killing?</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker> MINTER: </speaker>
               <ab> No, indeed he did not; he knew that I loved <persName ref="#taylor_william">Mr Taylor</persName> and
                  he had known it.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN: </speaker>
               <ab> Did he ever comment on that relation between you and
                  <persName ref="#taylor_william">Taylor</persName>?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab> No, he did not; I wouldn't have permitted him to; and I didn't comment on
                  his.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN: </speaker>
               <ab> I will use the word <objectName>"quarrel,"</objectName> but that may be
                  exaggerated; did you ever quarrel with <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Neilan</persName> over
                     <persName ref="#taylor_william">Taylor</persName>? </ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab> Absolutely not; absolutely not. <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName> is the
                  typification of the happy-go-lucky Irish spirit and tempera­ment. He does
                  perfectly terrible things to everybody, but everybody loves him. They are always
                  glad to see him again. As to harboring any deep-seated malice, I don't believe he
                  is capable of it. </ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN: </speaker>
               <ab> Could he have assumed at any time you and he, you and <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall
                     Neilan</persName> -- I am speaking of <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall Neilan</persName> now
                  -- Could he have assumed at any time that he might be or was engaged to you by
                  reason of your relations wtth him? </ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER: </speaker>
               <ab> Could <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall Neilan</persName> have assumed that <persName ref="#taylor_william">Mr
                     Taylor</persName> and I were engaged?</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN: </speaker>
               <ab> No, no; that you and <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall Neilan</persName> were enqaged?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab> No.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN: </speaker>
               <ab> Did you ever give him the impression that he might some day be successful in his
                  effort to marry you? </ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER: </speaker>
               <ab> Not in my own knowledge. If I have, it was more or less of a joking way. I think
                  I have at times said, "Well, <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName>, when are we going all
                  around the world on our honey-moon?" exactly in the same manner as I took him to
                  say, "Now, when you are my wedded bride we will do" so-and­-so.
                     <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName> has done that time after time. </ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN: </speaker>
               <ab> Might he not have taken you seriously?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker> MINTER: </speaker>
               <ab> I don't think so.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker> DORAN: </speaker>
               <ab> Do you know he did not?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER: </speaker>
               <ab> No, I don't know that he did not.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN:</speaker>
               <ab> Don't you know that he was really -- Don't you feel that he was really in love
                  with you?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab> I can't truthfully answer "Yes" or "no" to that, beoause I don't know; I am not
                  sure enough of <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Mr Neilan's</persName> nature. While I have known him a
                  great many years, well, I will say I have known him several years, he is the type
                  who flits back and forth, you know. - When you really think you know him he turns
                  to something else, and I don't know, so I have never permitted myself to form any
                  conclusions on his character; I don't know whether he has ever taken me seriously
                  or not. I always treated him more or less in a joking manner.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN: </speaker>
               <ab> I understand the night of the murrder you were with <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Mr
                     Neilan</persName>.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER: </speaker>

               <ab> We left location, he worked down at the <placeName>Salt Lake

                     three</time>, we left there and went to <placeName>his house</placeName>. How
                  long we were there I couldn't say; I didn't have a <objectName>watch</objectName>;
                  I imagine we were there about an hour or maybe more, and then we went on down to
                  the <placeName>studio</placeName> and we stayed until <time>dawn</time>, whatever
                  time that is. We then came on back to <placeName>my house</placeName>.
                     <persName ref="#shelby_charlotte">Mother</persName> was waiting for us and we got out and explained to
                  her. <persName ref="#shelby_charlotte">Mother</persName> knew he had had a verious talk and she felt sure
                     <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marhsall</persName> would try to come to our aid. My
                     <persName ref="#shelby_charlotte">mother</persName> is very fond of <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Mr Neilan</persName> and
                  the whole family. He said he was just dead tired. The man took his hours when hee
                  needed sleep to tell me these things. He was going to be up at <time
                     when-iso="08:00"> eight o'clock </time> that morning and he didn't even go to
                     <objectName>bed</objectName> that night. He just sat up in his
                     <objectName>clothes</objectName> and went out to work again at <time
                     when-iso="08:00"> eight o'clock </time>. Anyway, he said, "I tried to get your
                     <objectName type="communication">letters</objectName> for you. You know they
                  are a very important factor in the case, if they get hold of them." I was shocked
                  to find that he knew of my <objectName type="communication">letters</objectName>.
                  I said that I wrote some, and he said something about going to a
                     <objectName>newspaper</objectName> or getting hold of some body in
                     <placeName>Pasadena</placeName> to get me the <objectName type="communication"
                     >letters</objectName>. That part is not clear in my mind. I think I was so
                  tired at the time I couldn't understand him. I haven't seen him since or I would
                  have questioned him again about the <objectName type="communication"
                     >letters</objectName> just what he did. He told me I should have received them
                  that day. He asked me if I had gotten them and I said, "No, I haven't received the
                     <objectName type="communication">letters</objectName> today." He said, "Well, I
                  sent them to the <placeName>studio</placeName>, and I believe the <placeName>
                     studio</placeName>," the <placeName>Realart Studio</placeName> where I had last
                  worked. He said, "They are in Charley <persName ref="#eyton_charles">Eyton's</persName> hands now." He
                  either said <persName ref="#eyton_charles">Charley Eyton</persName> or <persName>Mr Carbut</persName>,
                  but I can't state this acutally because I was so tired at the time I could hardly
                  hear him and I was desperately interested to hear what he said about the
                     <objectName type="communication">letter</objectName>, and I strained all my
                  nerves to hear, but instead it came back and forth; it was hazy. I don't know the
                  exact words he spoke. Anyway, I remember saying, "Well, there is nothing in the
                     <objectName type="communication">letters</objectName> that the world can't read
                  except that it is horribly painful to me to have them read my
                     <objectName>letters</objectName> to him." He said, "You loved
                     <persName ref="#taylor_william">Billie</persName>, didn't you?" I said, "Yes,
                     <persName>Marshall</persName>, I loved him deeply and sincerely." And he said,
                  "Did you ever want to marry him?" Whereupon I replied, I said, "No, no; I know it
                  couldn't have been. It was not meant to be." Then we talked about -- Oh, yes. Then
                  he said, "Now, <persName ref="#minter_mary">Mary</persName>, I am going to tell you some very
                  important thing; they are going to hurt you, going to shock you, but before I say
                  a word I want you to consider <persName> Billie</persName> was just as crazy as a
                  March hare months before his death." He said, "I am going to recite a few
                  instances that <persName ref="#taylor_william">Bill</persName> told me about, things irrelevant to you,
                  to show he didn't do this only to you but to others of his very best friends." </ab>

               <ab>Marshall and <persName ref="#taylor_william">Mr Taylor</persName> were extremely good friends. I don't
                  think they saw each other often, but they were most affectionately fond of each
                  other. He said, "On several occasions <persName ref="#taylor_william">Bill</persName>" -- he spoke of
                  him as '<persName ref="#taylor_william">Bill</persName>' -- "has confessed to me that -- Oh, I am so
                  tired I can't think how I am trying­ to say it. He came up to my room in the
                     <placeName>club</placeName> one day and he said, "Oh, I know something about
                  you, <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName>, and those gold-tipped
                     <objectName>cigarettes</objectName> I found of yours." Whereupon
                     <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName> said he replied, "Well, you needn't say anything,
                  Bill" -- l don't know what it was, a <objectName>cigar</objectName> or something
                  of some personal nature that he recognized of <persName ref="#taylor_william">Mr Taylor</persName>'s at
                     <placeName>somebody's house</placeName>. I don't know whose house. He said,
                  "That makes us Elks. Don't you say anything about me, what I have been doing in a
                  joking, friendly manner." <persName ref="#taylor_william">Mr Taylor</persName>, he said, suddenly stood
                  up and looked at him very seriously, soberly, and said,
                     "<persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName>, I am surprised at the things you are doing
                  now-a-days." <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName> said, "Just what do you mean by that?"
                  and he said, "Why, what you said to your <persName>wife</persName> the other night

                     <persName ref="#swanson_gloria">Gloria Swanson</persName>." Maybe <persName
                     ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName> didn't tell me that. This is my impression.
                     <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName> said, "What do you mean?" And he
                  said, "Don't you remember the night we were at <placeName>Sunset Inn</placeName>
                  and you were sitting here and <persName ref="#swanson_gloria">Miss Swanson</persName> was
                  sitting there and your former wife, <persName >Gertrude
                     Banbrick</persName>, came in and said, 'Hello, <persName ref="#swanson_gloria"
                     >Gloria</persName>, how are you?' and <persName ref="#swanson_gloria"
                     >Gloria</persName> replied pleasantly, and you turned to <persName>Gertrude Bambrick</persName> and said, 'How dare you speak to
                  this girl?' pointing to <persName ref="#swanson_gloria">Gloria</persName>, the lady he
                  was with, 'How dare you speak to her? Don't you ever dare to speak to her again,'"
                  And <persName ref="#taylor_william">Mr Taylor</persName> was telling <persName
                     ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall Neilan</persName>. <persName ref="#neilan_marshall"
                     >Marshall</persName> said he looked at him and said, "What's the matter with
                  you, <persName ref="#taylor_william">Bill</persName>? Are you drunk?" He said, I haven't
                  had a drink," <persName ref="#taylor_william">Mr Taylor</persName> said, and he said, "The
                  funny part of it was he wasn't drunk." He couldn't detect it on his breath. "But
                  he looked quite as serious and sober as I do this minute." He said, "Why, tell me
                  what day you think this was." He said it was on a certain day -- I don't know if
                     <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName> told me the day or not. He said, on
                  a certain day at <placeName>Sunset Inn</placeName> recently. <persName
                     ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName> said, "Why, <persName ref="#taylor_william"
                     >Bill</persName>, at that time l I was in <placeName>New York City</placeName>
                  and was not in <placeName>Los Angeles</placeName> nor
                     <placeName>California</placeName>." <persName ref="#taylor_william">Mr
                     Taylor</persName> and he had quite a friendly argument over it, and he said, "I
                  know it is so; I was there myself and heard what you said upon this greeting
                  between those two girls." <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName> said he
                  thought perhaps he had lost his mind. The next day he called up, haVing that in
                  mind, <persName ref="#swanson_gloria">Miss Swanson</persName> and he said, "<persName
                     ref="#swanson_gloria">Gloria</persName>, am I going crazy? Have I lost my mind? Do you
                  remember of ever being at Sunset Inn with me when Gertrude Bambrick passed our
                  table and spoke to us pleasantly and railed at my former wife for having spoken to
                  you pleasantly and told her not to speak to you again?" And she said, "What on
                  earth are you talking about? What is this? I don't understand you," And he said,
                  "Do you ever remember seeing <persName ref="#taylor_william">Bill Taylor</persName> there
                  near us at any time on any such occasion?" And she said, "Certainly not, !the oniy
                  time I ever saw <persName ref="#taylor_william">William Taylor</persName> at
                     <placeName>Sunset Inn</placeName> was the night I was with" -- I don't know his
                  name, some friend of hers -- "and <persName ref="#taylor_william">Bill Taylor</persName>
                  was sitting away over on the other side by the wall and we were by the orchestra
                  on this side." He said, "Was I there?" And she said, "No. Don't you remember you
                  were in <placeName>New York</placeName> at the time?" He said, "That is one
                  instance, <persName ref="#minter_mary">Mary</persName>, of <persName ref="#taylor_william"
                     >Bill's</persName> failing mind, I have never cleared that up. <persName
                     ref="#taylor_william">Bill</persName> and I have discussed it many times since, and I
                  have always gone away puzzled, amazed, that he still stuck to his version of my
                  having spoken to my former wife as I did. I didn't see her; neither <persName
                     ref="#swanson_gloria">Miss Swanson</persName> saw her on that occasion." Then he said,
                  "On another occasion <persName ref="#taylor_william">Bill</persName> told me he had
                  received a <objectName ref="#letter">letter</objectName> from <persName>Blanche Sweet</persName>; that she told <persName ref="#taylor_william">Mr
                     Taylor</persName> that she was grieved he was sick;" that <persName
                     ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshell Neilan</persName> was calling on me and she intended to
                  sue him. <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName> said that sounded so unlike
                     <persName ref="#Sweet">Miss Sweet</persName> that he went to her and questioned
                  her, and he said, "<persName>Blanche</persName>, have you writtn to
                     <persName ref="#taylor_william">Bill</persName> lately?" She said, "Why, yes, I wrote
                  him a little <objectName ref="#letter">note</objectName> not so long ago thanking
                  him for some poinsettias he sent me <date>Christmas</date>." He aa1d, "Did you say
                  anything else?" She said, "No, not that I can remember." He said, "Did you ever
                  say that you regretted my going about with <persName ref="#minter_mary">Miss
                     Minter</persName> and that you intended to sue me?" She said, "Perfectly
                  ridiculous. What do you mean? I certainly did not say any such thing." </ab>

                  the ghastly thing I have to tell you." He said, "One time" -- I don't know whether
                  he said in his <placeName>room</placeName> or the <placeName>club</placeName>, he
                  was somewhere, I think in one of his own rooms, he, <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall
                     Nieilan</persName>, and <persName ref="#hoyt_arthur">Arthur Hoyt</persName>, <persName>Cap
                     Robinson</persName> -- He said <persName>"Cap Robinson</persName>"; maybe he
                  meant "Captain"; I don't know; I don't know how he is; I know
                     <persName ref="#hoyt_arthur">Arthur</persName> well. He said, "We were all standing around there
                  talking pleasantly" -- I think he said <persName>Antonio Moreno</persName> was
                  there. He said, "We were all talking pleasantly and <persName>Mr Taylor</persName>
                  suddenly started talking about you, and the talk grew finally more and more
                  personal and finally he said -- and this is terrible -- 'presently he said you had
                  been over in the <time>last two weeks</time>" -- I should say this is within at
                  least <time>three weeks</time> of <persName>Mr Taylor's</persName> death; I think
                  Marshall told me at the time, but I have forgotten the time. -- "within the last
                     <time>two weeks</time>, that you were undressed in his
                     <placeName>apartments</placeName>; that you beseeched him for his love; that he
                  resisted you, and finally persuaded you to leave his
                     <placeName>apartment</placeName>s."</ab>
               <ab> Marshall said that to me, and looked right at me. I could feel myself grow red.
                  I said, "Is that all you have to tell me about Mr Taylor?" He said, "Well, I could
                  recite some more instances about Bill's seeming insanity." He said, "I am certain
                  he was insane. He stood up and told those things as soberly as I am talking to you
                  now." </ab>

               <ab>Excuse me. Did he refer to <persName>Mr Taylor's</persName> physical

               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab>Yes, he said he was drunk at the time. <persName>Marshall</persName> has told
                     <persName>ma</persName> on several occasions, sometimes long ago and sometimes
                  recently that he always hated to see <persName>Bill</persName> drink because he
                  said, "You wouldn't know the man; he changes so; he gets maudlin and silly, smiles
                  in a foolish manner and wobbles and talks, oh, just the silly, foolish things." He
                  said, "None of his friends like to see him drink." At this time he was intoxicated
                  and he talked on and on and on about this thing." <persName>Marshall</persName>
                  said he got up and he told <persName>Bill</persName>, "You are insane; something
                  1s the matter with your mind. I would certainly take more vengeance on you if I
                  didn't think you were crazy," and that was tbe opinion of <persName>Arthur
                     Hoyt</persName> and <persName>Cap Robinson</persName> and
                     <persName>everybody</persName>. They were perfectly amazed that a man of
                     <persName>Mr Taylor's</persName> lovable, sweet, considerate, gentlemanly
                  disposition all through life should suddenly turn around and say this about not
                  only a woman, but about me, whom they all knew he admired and respected. </ab>
               <ab>When I heard of this thing, l just looked to <persName>Marshall</persName> and
                  said, "Is that all you have to tell me about Mr Taylor?" And he said, "Yes, that
                  is all. That 1s the ghastly <objectName>thing</objectName>. I know you are going
                  to hear this from somebody and I wanted you to hear it from me, and want to find
                  out what you knew about the murder of this man." </ab>
               <ab> By this time I was getting -- Oh, how can I can I express it? -- just exhausted
                  with shock, one shock after another and of all the <objectName>shocks</objectName>
                  I had received, this coming from hlm who I had no reason to doubt his word, I
                  couldn't believe it; not as I knew <persName>Mr Taylor</persName>, I couldn't
                  believe for an instant he had ever said these things to anybody, yet there
                     <persName>Marshall</persName> giving me names, dates and places. The thing was
                  too much for me. I got furious; and I said, "I don't believe you! I think you are
                  lying! How dare you say this about him to me! I never want to see you again?" He
                  got up and walked around the room for a minute and I was just broiling; I was just
                  furious; and he turned around and he said, "Well, Mary, some day you will realize
                  that I certainly am not saying this for any personal reason. It hurts me as it
                  must hurt you. I am simply telling you because you are bound to know it; it is the
                  truth and I wanted to be the one to tell you. </ab>

                  This conversation didn't come as quickly as I am te11ing it to you. It came with
                  long pauses; he would get up and walk around with his <objectName

                     <persName ref="# Marshall">Marshall</persName> thought I knew something about
                  it, and he looked at me and he said, <quote> "Now,<persName ref="#Mary">
                        Mary"</persName>
                  </quote> -- he got a little profane, he said, <quote> "Now, <persName ref="#Mary"

                  said, <quote> "Don't withhold anything." </quote> This was too much; not only had
                  he been telling me these things about <persName ref="#taylor_william"> Mr
                     Taylor,</persName> but there he sat evidently believing that I knew someth1ng.
                  I said, "Do you think that I killed <persName ref="#taylor_william">Mr Taylor? </persName>
                  " He said, <quote> "Oh, no; don't be silly. Now is no time to talk things like

                     kill <persName ref="#taylor_william"> William Desmond Taylor </persName> and I don't
                     know who murdered him."</quote> He said, <quote> "You don't? You don't know

                     course, you didn't put anybody on to do it, But" </quote> he said, <quote>
                     "don't you know somebody, don't you know some inti­mate details that other
                     people might not know? Can't you rack your brain and think who would have a
                     motive for killing him?" </quote> Then he sat there and we said words about pro
                  and con, trying to think, and I thought over everyrody I knew and I said this,
                  more or less in a humourous way, I said, <quote> "The only person I know who could
                     have had a possible motive for killing him would be <persName ref="#Ivers">
                        Mrs. Julia Crawford Ivers."</persName>
                  </quote> I was not serious when I said that. I was more or less humorous. She is a
                  lady I feel I ought to explain about, who has never done me a wrong thing in her
                  life and I have never done her a wrong thing, either, but she is a Christian
                  Science lady who has been associated with him as a scenario writer for many years;
                  she is quite a trusted, lovely woman, I am sure; a very honorable respectable
                  woman, but we don't like eaeh other. There is no reason, but we don't like each
                  other. Every time I wanted to see him, somehow she would be there and she had a
                  strange way of treating me. She would say, Oh yes, there is <persName ref="#Mary"
                     >little Mary.</persName> Here she comes." She would go on in this manner,
                     <quote> "Oh, there is <persName ref="#Mary">little Mary</persName> again, Oh,

               <ab>Questions by <persName ref="Doran">Mr. Doran</persName>:</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <ab select="statement">MINTER: She must have been 50. Her son was <persName
                     ref="Taylor">Mr Taylor's</persName> camera man. <persName ref="Vantrees"
                     >Jimmy</persName> was my camera man, <persName ref="Vantrees">Jim
                     Vantrees</persName>. I don't hate the woman, but she annoys me. She is one of
                  the few people in the world I dislike to see. In fact, the irony of fate it was
                  when I was in <placeName>France</placeName> after looking at the beautifUl Venus
                  de Muile in <placeName>Paris</placeName> at the Louvre, and after I had walked a
                  few steps done a long hall, thinking of this excellent statue, who should I see
                  but <persName ref="Ivers">Julia Crawford Ivers</persName>, a very, fat, large
                  woman. She did some more of these Christian Science things, and she had a very
                  unpleasant habit of whenever she would be with me and <persName ref="Taylor">Mr
                     Taylor</persName>, she would always come and twit my chin. So I said, in really
                  a joking manner -- I don't want to accuse the woman, because I don't think she had
                  anything to do with the matter -- I said <quote>"I don't know anyone who would
                     kill him but <persName ref="Ivers">Ju1ia Crawford Ivers</persName>."</quote>
                  <quote>"I always suspected the woman of being in love with him herself or she
                     might have killed him for that reason."</quote> He said, <quote>"My goodness!
                     You mustn't say that out loud; somebody will believe you."</quote> I said,
                     <quote>"I don't care if they do."</quote> I was in such a wild mood, Then, --
                  What else did we talk about? Oh! He talked about his
                     <objectName>productions</objectName><!-- @Devin - interesting ... we should talk about how constructs and objects play together. I've removed @type "Film" for now, but we can revisit -->
                  and said, <quote>"I certainly have a terrible time, working <time>day</time> and
                        <time>night</time> and a great deal depended upon <date>Saturday</date> and
                     we must get certain work finished <time>Friday</time>."</quote> We talked of
                     <date>Friday</date>
                  <time>night</time> and that he had to get up at <time when-iso="8:00:00">eight
                     o'clock</time>; he wasn't going to <objectName type="furniture"
                     >bed</objectName> at all; that the boys were calling for him at <time
                     when-iso="8:00:00">eight o'clock</time>, he said, and he knew if they didn't
                  call he would never get up out of his slumbers. They were going somewhere on
                     <placeName>location</placeName>, I understood, possibly at the
                     <placeName>studio</placeName>. He was just going <placeName>home</placeName>
                  and take a <placeName>shower</placeName>, get a shave if he felt like it, and go
                  on back and work some more. He said, <quote>"I am dog tired. I was never so
                     exhausted, just dead."</quote> Finally I said, <quote>"Do you rea1ize this
                     looks awful, being here all this time?"</quote> And he said, <quote>"I can't
                     help it if it does. I had to tell you these things and wanted to find out what
                     you knew about this case. That I know you knew <persName ref="Bill"
                        >Bill</persName> very well, probably better than any of us and"</quote> --
                  Oh, yes. He also asked me to tel1 him my feelings toward <persName ref="Taylor">Mr
                     Taylor</persName>, exactly what everybody has been asking me, and I told him as
                  I have been telling you, I loved him deeply, sincerely and absolutely; that I
                  loved him truly, loved him in an all-around way, I cared for his health; his
                  health came before my happiness and when he was ill -- and he didn't like to see
                  anyone when he was ill-- my natural impulse was to go to him and be with him and
                  sit up night after night with him, if necessary. l didn't do it; I didn t even
                  attempt to, because he didn't want me to, and although I had sat in the dark, not
                  knowing anything and worrying about it, I did that rather than intrude myself upon
                  him when he didn't want me.</ab>

            <sp>

                  <time>night</time>, because it was still <time>nighttime</time>. The five of us
                  arrived there, oh, I don't know, he didn't finish work until between <time
                     when-iso="2:30:00">two-thirty</time> and <time when-iso="3:00:00">three
                     o'c1ock</time>, maybe after <time when-iso="3:00:00">three</time>; I didn't
                  have a watch at that <time>time</time>.</ab>

            </sp>

            <sp>
               <ab>MINTER: Now, let me see, we stayed at <placeName><persName ref="Marshall"
                        >Marshall</persName>'s house</placeName> with the <objectName
                     type="food_drink">eggs</objectName> and things at least an <time>hour</time>,
                  maybe <time>two hours</time>; I am not certain of that at all; I don't think much
                  more than an <time>hour</time>. Then we went right on to the

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab> I think maybe we spent <time>a couple of hours</time>; maybe <time>three
                     hours</time>; it takes a good while to go from <placeName>Salt Lake
                     station</placeName> up to <placeName>Marshall's home on Sunset
                     Boulevard</placeName>. It would take <time>at least forty-five minutes</time>,
                  I think. Then it takes some time to go from <placeName>his home</placeName> to
                     <placeName>the studio</placeName>, way out <placeName>on Santa Monica

                     <quote>"Let's get out of here. I am burning up alive."</quote> It was very cold
                  when we came in the house and we put on steam and then he got terribly hot. I
                  don't know what was the matter with me, I wouldn't take off <objectName>my
                     coat</objectName>. He said, <quote>"If you are going to stay there and burn,
                     let's go out and talk."</quote> We got in <objectName>the car</objectName> and
                  drove around for a while. No, it is not a fact that he said in <placeName>the
                     house</placeName>, <quote>"We must go to <placeName>the studio</placeName> and
                     talk."</quote> I think I said that at first; it is not so. He said,
                     <quote>"Let's go out and talk."</quote> Then it was very bitterly cold outside,

               <ab>Yes; we drove around, went out <placeName>Sunset Boulevard</placeName> and went

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab>Why, about this thing about <persName ref="#taylor_william_william">Mr Taylor</persName>
                  and then also I was rather peeved at <persName ref="#neilan_marshall"
                     >Marshall</persName> at the time because I hadn't heard from him in weeks.
                  "Peeved" is hardly the word. That sounds more as if I am interested in <persName
                     ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName>, and I am; I like him, but l wasn't
                  caring particularly; I simply said, <quote>"Well, <persName ref="#neilan_marshall"
                        >Marshall</persName>, it was not a very nice thing the way you ran off the
                     last time. I understood they were going out to dinner and you were coming to
                        <placeName>my house</placeName> to dinner and suddenly you went to
                        <placeName>San Francisco</placeName> without so much as a
                     fare-thee-well."</quote>' He said, <quote>"You know I do those things."</quote>
                  I said, <quote>"Yes, you do those things, and it ts very annoying, but your
                     friends love you and love you yet in spite of those funny little tricks you do,
                     darting here and there. I don't know, I am in no mood to take this foolishness;
                     I want good wholesome friendship, but I want to know when you are going to
                     appear."</quote> Many times a whole dinner has gotten cold waiting for him.
                  When we had a dinner party at <placeName>our house</placeName>, or other people
                  have given parties, they have waited on <persName ref="#neilan_marshall"
                     >Marshall</persName> for <time>two or three hours</time> and he finally would
                  come along smiling sweetly at everybody and they couldn't scold him. I was more or
                  less taking him to task for his 1ife in general, saying he should not do those
                  things; it was very annoying and I was not going to put up with it. He was sweet
                  and Irish and said, <quote>"You wouldn't be angry with me?"</quote> And I said,
                     <quote>"No, I wouldn't be."</quote> That is the way we got out of that. There
                  was nothing serious in the talk, Just the way we always talked. </ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN:</speaker>
               <ab>Then you finally went to <placeName>the studio</placeName>?</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab>Finally he said, <quote>"Now, I have got something very important to tell you,
                     something that is going to hurt your feelings terribly, but I must tell you; we
                     wi11 go in <placeName>the studio</placeName> and talk."</quote> Our teeth were
                  chatter1ng with cold and we went in there and he turned on the steam and I sat in
                  this <objectName>fur coat</objectName> in a <objectName>wicker chair</objectName>,
                  and he said, <quote>"This is going to b, a nine or "nineteen-days talk of the
                     world"</quote> Then he told me all the things I have been telling you. There
                  may have been some more, and some thlngs I have said may not be exactly accurate,
                  but the gist of the thing is entirely accurate. </ab>

               <ab>Yes, and then he would dart away again. I mean he would call me up -- He can't
                  call me up, because I have no <objectName>telephone</objectName>; he would send me
                     <objectName>flowers</objectName>, too, and suddenly I would not hear from him
                  for two or <time>three weeks</time>. As I said to him in the
                     <objectName>car</objectName>, not particularly about that but about other
                  things, about dinner engagements, about &amp; appointments, I said, "You know,

                  I am not going to see you, and just what you are going to do, and I am in no mood

               <ab>Yes. This night for the time being, I was furious [missing page] [...]
                     <persName>Mr Neilan</persName> -- <persName>Taylor's</persName>, and at the
                  time of <persName>Mr Taylor's</persName> death, <persName>Harry</persName> was the
                     <roleName>assistant director</roleName> in <persName>Mr Taylor's</persName>
                  companies there, and he had said <persName>Harry</persName> had been in the
                     <placeName>room</placeName> looking over the effects -- Just a minute. I wonder
                  if <persName>Charles Maigne</persName> told me this. I think <persName>Mr
                     Neilan</persName> told me this, too, that <persName>Harry</persName> bad gotten
                  the <objectName>letters</objectName> and taken them to <persName>Jim
                     Vantrees</persName>, the <roleName><objectName>camera</objectName>
                     man</roleName>, whereupon I remarked, <quote>"I will bet <persName>Mrs
                        Ivers</persName> had them,"</quote> and I think he said,
                        <quote>"<persName>Jim</persName> gave them to <persName>Mr
                     Eyton</persName>,"</quote> and that <persName>Mr Eyton</persName> turned some
                  of them over to the Examiner. I am so afraid l am telling things that are not so
                  here, <persName>Mr Doran</persName>; I don't mean to, but I couldn't get all of
                  it. That is as clear as I can make it. Anyway, I do remember this part, he said he
                  heard about them, and I don't know how he heard about them, and that he went down,
                  I believe, to the Examiner, to get ahold of them and he had something to do with
                     <placeName>Pasadena</placeName>, a man, he did tell me the man's name. I don't
                  remember his name, but I believe it be­gan with "S", and this man,
                     <persName>Marshall</persName> said he was the big man over the entire Examiner
                  force, told him to go down and take the <objectName>letters</objectName>. He said,
                     <quote>"Of course, if you breathe this it wi11 just about throw me in
                        <placeName>jail</placeName> for the rest of my life,"</quote> but I don't
                  believe it will. Then he said, <quote>"Didn't you get them today?"</quote> I said,
                     <quote>"I did not."</quote> As well as I remember,
                     <persName>Marshall</persName> said, <quote>"I then sent them to the
                        <placeName>Realart Studio</placeName> and they ought to be in
                        <persName>Charley's</persName> hands now or Mr Garbut."</quote> This whole
                     <date>Friday night</date> is most hasy in my recollection.</ab>

               <ab> No, I did not, because at the time, when I asked him if he suspected me of
                  killing <persName>Mr Taylor</persName>, we had that out; he assured me he didn't
                  suspect any such thing, but he was very much impressed with the gravity of the
                  situation. In fact, evidently he knew at that time exactly how these things were
                  going to turn out. I mean that they would drag everybody's name into it; that the
                  papers could get hold of for the notoriety of it. He said, "This involves picture
                  people and you know how <persName>Hearst</persName> hates the picture people.
                     <persName>Hearst</persName> would do anything &amp; could if he thought you did
                  know <persName>Mr Taylor</persName>," "There are lots of prominent people in the
                  profession who knew him and loved him. They are certainly going to drag your name
                  into it." </ab>

               <ab> I was at <placeName>home</placeName> reading the <objectName>Cruise of the
                     Kewa</objectName>. It is a humorous <objectName>book</objectName>; it is really
                  a travesty of <persName>Frederick O'Brien's</persName> stories of the South Seas.
                  It is very funny, and I laid there laughing all the <time>evening</time>. I was
                  very -- right while I was laying on the <objectName>couch</objectName> reading
                  aloud to <persName>mother</persName> and sister and we were all laughing heartily
                  at that time, and at the same time <persName>Mr Taylor</persName> was being
                  murdered. It seems very horrible to me. </ab>

               <ab> Let me see. I don't remember any. Possibly <persName>Mr Stockdale</persName>, he
                  generally did, or maybe somebody dropped in. I don't just remember. Usually every
                  evening somebody drops [page 40] in. I know they were not there at the time I was
                  reading the book. </ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker> MINTER: </speaker>
               <ab> Yes, unless I put my <objectName>car</objectName> in the garage called the
                     <placeName>Standard Garage</placeName>. I leave it there sometimes, the
                     <placeName>Standard Garage</placeName> on <placeName>Hollywood Boulevard and
                     Western Avenue</placeName>. Sometimes when my girl friends stop with me and
                  have her <objectName>car</objectName>, I would move out and put it in this garage
                  and maybe wouldn't call for it for several days. I haven't been feeling well for
                  some time; I have had bronchitis. I hadn't gotten well when this awful shock came
                  to me, and I haven't used the little car very much.</ab>

                  mechanically. I sit, sleep, get up, walk and dress, and I don't see exactly what I
                  am doing." </ab>
