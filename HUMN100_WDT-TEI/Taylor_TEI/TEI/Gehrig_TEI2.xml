               <ab>MINTER: <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName> at that time said to me, <quote>"And you know <persName>Blanche</persName> doesn't lie. She
                  certainly doesn't lie; tbat is her reputation all over the world, over the <objectName type="furniture">picture</objectName>
                  game. I have heard that hundreds of times myself; I am pretty sure it is so."</quote> He
                  said, "Now, that is another instance of poor <persName ref="#taylor_william">Bill's</persName> insanity. Now, <persName ref="#minter_mary">Mary</persName>, here is
                  the ghastly thing I have to tell you." He said, "One time" -- I don't know whether
                  he said in his <placeName>room</placeName> or the <placeName>club</placeName>, he was somewhere, I think in one of his own
                  rooms, he, <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall Nieilan</persName>, and <persName>Arthur Hoyt</persName>, <persName>Cap Robinson</persName> -- He said <persName>"Cap
                  Robinson</persName>"; maybe he meant "Captain"; I don't know; I don't know how he is; I know
                  <persName>Arthur</persName> well. He said, "We were all standing around there talking pleasantly" -- I
                  think he said <persName>Antonio Moreno</persName> was there. He said, "We were all talking pleasantly
                  and <persName>Mr Taylor</persName> suddenly started talking about you, and the talk grew finally more
                  and more personal and finally he said -- and this is terrible -- 'presently he
                  said you had been over in the <time>last two weeks</time>" -- I should say this is within at
                  least <time>three weeks</time> of <persName ref="#taylor_william">Mr Taylor's</persName> death; I think Marshall told me at the time, but
                  I have forgotten the time. -- "within the last <time>two weeks</time>, that you were undressed
                  in his <placeName>apartments</placeName>; that you beseeched him for his love; that he resisted you, and
                  finally persuaded you to leave his <placeName>apartment</placeName>s."</ab>
               <ab> Marshall said that to me, and looked right at me. I could feel myself grow red.
                  I said, "Is that all you have to tell me about Mr Taylor?" He said, "Well, I could
                  recite some more instances about Bill's seeming insanity." He said, "I am certain
                  he was insane. He stood up and told those things as soberly as I am talking to you
                  now." </ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MR MOTT:</speaker>
               <ab>Excuse me. Did he refer to <persName ref="#taylor_william">Mr Taylor's</persName> physical condition?</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab>Yes, he said he was drunk at the time. <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName> has told <persName ref="#shelby_charlotte">ma</persName> on several occasions,
                  sometimes long ago and sometimes recently that he always hated to see <persName>Bill</persName> drink
                  because he said, "You wouldn't know the man; he changes so; he gets maudlin and
                  silly, smiles in a foolish manner and wobbles and talks, oh, just the silly,
                  foolish things." He said, "None of his friends like to see him drink." At this
                  time he was intoxicated and he talked on and on and on about this thing." <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName>
                  said he got up and he told <persName ref="#taylor_william">Bill</persName>, "You are insane; something 1s the matter with
                  your mind. I would certainly take more vengeance on you if I didn't think you were
                  crazy," and that was tbe opinion of <persName>Arthur Hoyt</persName> and <persName>Cap Robinson</persName> and everybody.
                  They were perfectly amazed that a man of <persName ref="#taylor_william">Mr Taylor's</persName> lovable, sweet, considerate,
                  gentlemanly disposition all through life should suddenly turn around and say this
                  about not only a woman, but about me, whom they all knew he admired and respected. </ab>
               <ab>When I heard of this thing, l just looked to <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName> and said, "Is that all you
                  have to tell me about Mr Taylor?" And he said, "Yes, that is all. That 1s the
                  ghastly <objectName>thing</objectName>. I know you are going to hear this from somebody and I wanted you to
                  hear it from me, and want to find out what you knew about the murder of this man." </ab>
               <ab> By this time I was getting -- Oh, how can I can I express it? -- just exhausted
                  with shock, one shock after another and of all the <objectName>shocks</objectName> I had received, this
                  coming from hlm who I had no reason to doubt his word, I couldn't believe it; not
                  as I knew <persName ref="#taylor_william">Mr Taylor</persName>, I couldn't believe for an instant he had ever said these
                  things to anybody, yet there <persName>Marshall</persName> giving me names, dates and places. The thing
                  was too much for me. I got furious; and I said, "I don't believe you! I think you
                  are lying! How dare you say this about him to me! I never want to see you again?"
                  He got up and walked around the room for a minute and I was just broiling; I was
                  just furious; and he turned around and he said, "Well, Mary, some day you will
                  realize that I certainly am not saying this for any personal reason. It hurts me
                  as it must hurt you. I am simply telling you because you are bound to know it; it
                  is the truth and I wanted to be the one to tell you. </ab>
