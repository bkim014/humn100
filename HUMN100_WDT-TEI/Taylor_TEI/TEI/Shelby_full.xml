               <ab>He said, "<persName ref="shelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName>, I just wanted to call you
                  up and tell you. I am at the <placeName>studio</placeName>. <persName ref="taylor"
                     >William Desmond Taylor</persName> was found dead <time>this morning</time>."
                  "Oh," I said, "that's terrible." That's all he knew. ** I turned to these gentlemen
                  and said, "Oh, my, it's terrible. A man who directed <persName ref="minter">my
                     daughter</persName>, a very charming gentleman, was found dead <time>this
                        morning</time>." ** In a few minutes the <objectName type="furniture"
                           >telephone</objectName> rang again. ** This time <persName ref="berger">Miss
                              Berger</persName> said, "<persName ref="taylor">William Desmond Taylor</persName>
                  was murdered this morning. He was shot." I said, "Oh, my, this is terrible; the man
                  was murdered? Was shot?" So we discussed that and the organ man knew I was waiting to
                  go out with <persName ref="rice">Mr. Rice</persName> so ** <persName ref="rice">Mr.
                     Rice</persName> and I got in his <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName> **
                  and I said, "<persName ref="rice">Mr. Rice</persName>, do you mind if I stop at my
                  <objectName>house</objectName> and tell my people?" ** and it seems to me that on
                  the way crossing <placeName>Vermont</placeName> I met my mother coming over in a
                  <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName> with the <persName role="chauffeur"
                     >chauffeur</persName> and I just waved to her to turn around and come on back with
                  us. I remember that distinctly. ** I was in a great hurry because <persName
                     ref="rice">Mr. Rice</persName> was waiting for me in front, and I remember the
                  chauffeur had parked my <objectName type="vehicle">blue Packard</objectName> in the
                  <placeName>driveway</placeName>, and something was said about <persName

                        >car</objectName>. <persName ref="eaton">Chauncey</persName> had gone to get
                  <persName ref="minter">Mary's</persName>
                  <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName>. However, I went
                  <placeName>upstairs</placeName> in a great hurry, and I said, "Oh, <persName
                     ref="ivers">Julia</persName>, dear, <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName>
                  was murdered last night." She said, "Oh, it isn't possible. I can't believe it. It
                  isn't true." I said, "Oh, yes, it is. <persName ref="berger">Miss Berger</persName>
                  told me so." **</ab>

               <ab> I said, "<persName ref="eaton">Chauncey</persName>, what did you tell them?" He
                  said, "I told them that you called me up very early that morning, about <time>half

                  you wanted to go over to the <placeName>Hobart house</placeName>." I said, "The

                  said, "Why, I couldn't have known until after <time>9 o'clock</time>." He said that
                  he drove me over that morning and said that I was at the window with the <objectName

                  nothing, it is just a lapse of memory, it is of no consequence." And finally he saw
                  he was in the wrong. I explained to him that <persName ref="rice">Mr. Rice</persName>
