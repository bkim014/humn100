               <ab> I had always known that this was just an exquisite chapter in my life that must
                  necessarily be a brief one: I couldn't bear to part with it; it was just a
                  beautiful thing that seldom occurs in the <date when-iso="1922">world today</date> as I see it, as it is
                  forced upon me. It as simply a beautiful white flame; I met him; I had always been
                  a reserved, very retiring young girl, and he was the first man and the only man
                  who ever embodied all the glories of manhood in one private body. He represented
                  that to me. He never by look, by word or by deed gave me any reason to doubt any
                  of my ideals that were placed in him absolutely. At the time our love first
                  formulated he said to me, <quote>"Mary, this is not right. You are May and I am December,
                  and this is not right. I know it is best that we must part."</quote> This was at the very
                  beginning of it, and I said, <quote>"Of course, I don't want to do any immodest or bold
                  thing; I couldn't try to withhold a person's love for me who didn't care for me.""
                  I said, "I know that you are many years older than I, but I couldn't love anybody
                  as I love you. I simply love you."</quote> And we did try to part, We tried it again and
                  again, and then he would beoome ill. At one time I had almost resolved to see him
                  no more, and he was taken ill and nobody else cared, [page 6] really cared whether
                  he ate his dinner or whether he dressed warm1y enough, whether he took care of
                  himself, and I couldn't bear for him to suffer. It was not only a love of
                  sweetheart, but I wanted to be his nurse. I wanted to hold his head when it was
                  aching. I wanted him to tell me his mental troubles, his heart troubles, and let
                  me soothe them away for him as I would for a little child. I forgot the man's age;
                  it meant nothing to me. The only thing I wanted was to serve him as I would have
                  served the Lord or a little child, and then it just passed away; for months at a
                  time I wouldn't see him and I didn't know why. Finally, I decided there was no
                  use; it must come to an end and I went there on the night of the 23d to give him
                  <objectName>this letter</objectName> telling him "goodbye." I had reason to believe, in the awful
                  vernacular of the day, that it was over anyway, but I went there to say "goodbye"
                  myself. He said,<quote> "It is rather late, isn't it, Mary?"</quote> when he opened the door. I
                  said, <quote>"Yes, but don't you realize that I had to come to see you? You know
                     <persName ref="Charlotte Shelby">Mama</persName> has been sick for three months and you have been ill
                  and I have been frightfully worried and you haven't even had the kindness to call
                  me to tell me that you were i11 and that I must not expect to see you to tell mo
                  that things are all right."</quote></ab>
               <ab> I said, <quote>"I don't care if you don't wish to see me, because it hurts me, but it wouldn't have hurt one-millionth as much if you had just explained to me and not leave me in the dark."</quote> He said, <quote>"Mary I couldn't help it; I couldn't help it and I can't explain it to you."</quote></ab>
               <ab> Oh, I don't know! I have told this thing so many times, Mr Doran, that the words
                  just - I can't tell it even as it is; I can't even express it to you as it really
                  is. There is so much more to it.</ab>
