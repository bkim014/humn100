            <ab>It was afterwards. I don't know yet whether he really meant it; maybe he was as

            <ab>Yes, and then he would dart away again. I mean he would call me up -- He can't call
               me up, because I have no <objectName type="communication">telephone</objectName>; he would send me
                  <objectName type="miscellaneous">flowers</objectName>, too, and suddenly I would not hear from him for
               two or <time>three weeks</time>. As I said to him in the
               <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName>, not particularly about that but about other things,
               about dinner engagements, about &amp; appointments, I said, "You know,
                  <persName ref="nelian_marshall">Marshall</persName>, I never know when l am going to see you and when I
               am not going to see you, and just what you are going to do, and I am in no mood to go

               only married a <time>few days</time>. I think he married when he was twenty or

            <ab>We did part more or less friendly, as I always did with
                  <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName>, no matter how angry I would become with him,
               somehow you can't bear malice against that boy.</ab>

            <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
            <ab>Yes. This night for the time being, I was furious [missing page] [...] <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Mr
                  Neilan</persName> -- <persName ref="#taylor_william">Taylor's</persName>, and at the time of
                  <persName ref="#taylor_william">Mr Taylor's</persName> death, <persName ref="#fellows_harry">Harry</persName> was the
                  <roleName>assistant director</roleName> in <persName ref="#taylor_william">Mr Taylor's</persName>
               companies there, and he had said <persName ref="#fellows_harry">Harry</persName> had been in the
                  <placeName>room</placeName> looking over the effects -- Just a minute. I wonder if
                  <persName ref="#maigne_charles">Charles Maigne</persName> told me this. I think <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Mr
                  Neilan</persName> told me this, too, that <persName>Harry</persName> bad gotten
               the <objectName type="miscellaneous">letters</objectName> and taken them to <persName ref="#vantrees_james">Jim
                  Vantrees</persName>, the <roleName><objectName>camera</objectName> man</roleName>,
               whereupon I remarked, <quote>"I will bet <persName>Mrs Ivers</persName> had
                  them,"</quote> and I think he said, <quote>"<persName ref="#vantrees_james">Jim</persName> gave them to
                     <persName ref="#eyton_charles">Mr Eyton</persName>,"</quote> and that <persName ref="#eyton_charles">Mr Eyton</persName>
               turned some of them over to the Examiner. I am so afraid l am telling things that are
               not so here, <persName ref="#doran_william">Mr Doran</persName>; I don't mean to, but I couldn't get all
               of it. That is as clear as I can make it. Anyway, I do remember this part, he said he
               heard about them, and I don't know how he heard about them, and that he went down, I
               believe, to the Examiner, to get ahold of them and he had something to do with
                  <placeName>Pasadena</placeName>, a man, he did tell me the man's name. I don't
               remember his name, but I believe it be­gan with "S", and this man,
                  <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName> said he was the big man over the entire Examiner
               force, told him to go down and take the <objectName type="miscellaneous">letters</objectName>. He said,
                  <quote>"Of course, if you breathe this it wi11 just about throw me in
                     <placeName>jail</placeName> for the rest of my life,"</quote> but I don't
               believe it will. Then he said, <quote>"Didn't you get them today?"</quote> I said,
                  <quote>"I did not."</quote> As well as I remember, <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName>
               said, <quote>"I then sent them to the <placeName>Realart Studio</placeName> and they
                  ought to be in <persName ref="#maigne_charles">Charley's</persName> hands now or Mr Garbut."</quote>
               This whole <date>Friday night</date> is most hasy in my recollection.</ab>
