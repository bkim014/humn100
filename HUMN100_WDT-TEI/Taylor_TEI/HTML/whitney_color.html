         CHARLOTTE WHITNEY<font xmlns="" color="orange">Statement taken ll-28-25</font><font xmlns="" color="pink"> Secretary to Mrs. Shelby</font></h2>
      <hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">[Meghan Quinn]</font></h3><br><strong xmlns="">WHITNEY: </strong>** and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font> stood up and looked at her <font xmlns="" color="blue">mother</font> and said, "Do you really mean that?" and Mrs. Shelby said, "I certainly do." She accused her of being intimate with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor</font>and then made other remarks. ** <font xmlns="" color="blue">She</font> locked herself in her <font xmlns="" color="green"> mother's room </font>** and she got the <font xmlns="" color="purple">gun</font> and tried to kill herself, but there was a safety catch on it and it wouldn't go
         off. **  <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font> was monkeying with this thing and finally the catch released itself and the darn
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">gun</font> went off. **</br><br><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>What kind of a <font xmlns="" color="purple">gun</font> was that?</br><br><strong xmlns="">WHITNEY: </strong><font xmlns="" color="purple">Revolver</font>. A little snub-nosed thing.</br><br><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Was it a black one?</br><br><strong xmlns="">WHITNEY: </strong>Yes.</br><br><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Who did the <font xmlns="" color="purple">gun</font> belong to?</br><br><strong xmlns="">WHITNEY: </strong><font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs. Shelby</font>.</br><br><strong xmlns="">POLICE:  </strong>Do you know how long <font xmlns="" color="blue">she</font> had it?</br><br><strong xmlns="">WHITNEY: </strong>Oh, she always carried a <font xmlns="" color="purple">gun</font>. I mean we always kept one in the <font xmlns="" color="green">house</font>.</br><br><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong><font xmlns="" color="blue">She</font> knew how to handle a <font xmlns="" color="purple">gun</font>?</br><br><strong xmlns="">WHITNEY: </strong>Oh, I should say so.  ** <font xmlns="" color="orange">one night</font> when we (witness and Mrs. Shelby) went down to <font xmlns="" color="green">Taylor's</font> after <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary </font>, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs. Shelby</font> took the <font xmlns="" color="purple">gun</font>, but I don't think <font xmlns="" color="blue">she</font> had any intention of using it on <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font>.</br><br><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Did she (Shelby) threaten to kill him (Taylor)?</br><br><strong xmlns="">WHITNEY: </strong>Yes. Several people heard that. It was in <font xmlns="" color="green">my office</font>.</br><br><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>When was <font xmlns="" color="purple">it</font> in your office?</br><br><strong xmlns="">WHITNEY: </strong>That was in <font xmlns="" color="orange">1920</font>, in the summer. He (Taylor) had finished directing with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font>. Charley Maigne was directing her and Charley was in the <font xmlns="" color="green">office</font>, and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor</font> was in the office. **</br><br><strong xmlns="">WHITNEY: </strong>** She said, "If I ever catch you hanging around Mary again, I will blow your god damned brains
         out."<font xmlns="" color="blue">She</font> walked right up to <font xmlns="" color="blue">him</font>. She was just livid with rage and shook her <font xmlns="" color="purple">fist</font> in his <font xmlns="" color="purple">face</font> and swore dozens of times.</br><br><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Do you know of an incident that occurred in which <font xmlns="" color="blue">Monte Blue</font> was supposed to have been run out of the <font xmlns="" color="green">dressing room</font> with a <font xmlns="" color="purple">gun</font> by <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs. Shelby</font>?</br><br><strong xmlns="">WHITNEY: </strong>Well, I don't know that <font xmlns="" color="blue">she</font> had a <font xmlns="" color="purple">gun</font>, but I know that he was run out of the <font xmlns="" color="green">dressing room</font>, because he ran into my <font xmlns="" color="green">office</font> from the dressing room. (Referring to incidents surrounding visit of Mrs. Shelby
         to Taylor's residence in search of Mary) ** She (Mrs. Shelby) said, "I will take my gun, and if I find her there I am going to kill her." I begged her not to take it ** She wouldn't do it, so she went with the <font xmlns="" color="purple">gun.</font> **</br><br><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>She had the <font xmlns="" color="purple">gun</font> with her at that time?</br><br><strong xmlns="">WHITNEY: </strong>She had it in her <font xmlns="" color="purple">hand</font> and her <font xmlns="" color="purple">coat sleeve</font>; she had big coat sleeves and the <font xmlns="" color="purple">gun</font> was in her <font xmlns="" color="purple">hand</font> hid by her coat sleeve.</br><br><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Do you know of any other trouble with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor</font> that <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs. Shelby</font> had?</br><br><strong xmlns="">WHITNEY: </strong>They fought all the time. Always on the <font xmlns="" color="green">set</font> when he was directing.</br><br><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Was the situation getting worse a11 the time?</br><br><strong xmlns="">WHITNEY: </strong>A11 the time. It was terrible.</br><br><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Was there anyone else present at any of these battles, that you recall, over <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font>?</br><br><strong xmlns="">WHITNEY: </strong>Well, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Earl Stockdale</font>. I am sure he was present.</br><br><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Do you know any of her servants (Shelby's) at the time of the murder?</br><br><strong xmlns="">WHITNEY: </strong>I knew them only by their first names. ** We had a butler named <font xmlns="" color="blue">Frederick</font>., a butler named Â­<font xmlns="" color="blue">Ernest</font>, and a cook named <font xmlns="" color="blue">Pauline</font>. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Edith Stewart</font> was <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary's</font> personal maid at that time</br><br><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Can you think of any friends of yours, or any acquaintances of <font xmlns="" color="blue">Shelby</font>, in
         any way at all, that were associating with or closely associated with them immediately
         prior to, or immediately after, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor's</font> murder?</br><br><strong xmlns="">WHITNEY: </strong><font xmlns="" color="blue">M. George Periolet.</font></br><br><strong xmlns="">WHITNEY: </strong>He is at <font xmlns="" color="green">Engstrom Apartments, Los Angeles.</font> ** Have you talked to <font xmlns="" color="blue">Jeanne McPherson</font> at all? Jeanne knows a great, big, large lot. ** Jeanne came over to see <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font> a day or so after the murder. She would be a good person for you to talk to. And
         her mother , <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs. O'Neil</font>.</br><br><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Well, going back to that old subject of the <font xmlns="" color="purple">gun</font>, I just wanted to be sure that <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs. Shelby</font> had it in the <font xmlns="" color="green">house</font> for a long time.</br><br><strong xmlns="">WHITNEY: </strong>Oh yes, there was always a <font xmlns="" color="purple">gun</font>.</br><br><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>If anybody said that <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs. She1by</font> did not know anything about a <font xmlns="" color="purple">pistol or revolver</font>, and was afraid of one, that would not be true?</br><br><strong xmlns="">WHITNEY: </strong>That's ridiculous. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs. Shelby</font> was not afraid of anything.</br><hr />
