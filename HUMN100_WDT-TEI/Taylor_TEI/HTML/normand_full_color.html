      <hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue"> Olivia Witzmann </font></h3><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Please state your name. <br/>
      <strong xmlns="">NORMAND:  </strong><font xmlns="" color="blue"> Mabel Normand.</font></br><br><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong> Where do you reside? <br/>
      <strong xmlns=""> NORMAND:  </strong><font xmlns="" color="green">3089 West Seventh.</font><br/>
      <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong> What is your occupation? <br/>
      <strong xmlns=""> NORMAND:  </strong> Motion pictures. <br/>
      <strong xmlns=""> NANCE:  </strong> Miss Normand, were you acquainted with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font>, the
         deceased in this case? <br/>
         <strong xmlns=""> NORMAND: </strong> Yes. <br/>
         <strong xmlns=""> NANCE:  </strong> Did you see him on the evening before his death occurred? </br><br><strong xmlns=""> NORMAND:  </strong> Yes, I did. <br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>And where did you see him? <br/>
         <strong xmlns=""> NORMAND: </strong>Will I tell you when I went in there and when I came out? <br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE:  </strong>Did you see him at his <font xmlns="" color="green">home</font>? <br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NORMAND: </strong>Oh, yes. <br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>And you were with him about how long on that occasion?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NORMAND:  </strong>I got there about <font xmlns="" color="orange">7 o'clock </font>and left at a <font xmlns="" color="orange">quarter to
            8</font>.<br/>
            <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>And when you left <font xmlns="" color="green">his place</font>, did you leave him in
         <font xmlns="" color="green">the house</font>, or <font xmlns="" color="green">outside</font>?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NORMAND: </strong> No, he came down to my <font xmlns="" color="purple">car</font> with me.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Where was your <font xmlns="" color="purple">car</font>?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NORMAND:  </strong>Right in front of <font xmlns="" color="green">the court</font>.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE:  </strong><font xmlns="" color="green">On Alvarado street?</font><br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NORMAND: </strong>Yes, on the <font xmlns="" color="green">hill</font>. <br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>He accompanied you to your <font xmlns="" color="purple">car</font>? </br><br><strong xmlns=""> NORMAND: </strong>Yes.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE:  </strong>Was he still there when you drove away? <br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NORMAND:  </strong>Yes, as my <font xmlns="" color="purple"> car </font>turned around, I waved <font xmlns="" color="purple"> my
            hand</font> at him; he was partly up a little
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">stairs</font> there.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE:  </strong> the time you were in <font xmlns="" color="green">the house</font>, was anybody also in
         <font xmlns="" color="green">the house</font>? <br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NORMAND: </strong>Yes, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Henry</font>, his man.<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""> NANCE:  </strong><font xmlns="" color="blue">Henry Peavey</font>? <br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NORMAND: </strong> Yes.<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""> NANCE:  </strong>Do you know whether <font xmlns="" color="blue"> Mr. Peavey</font> left <font xmlns="" color="green">the
            house</font> before you did or not?<br/>
            <strong xmlns="">NORMAND:  </strong>Yes, he did; he left about, I should say about <font xmlns="" color="orange">15 or 20 minutes</font>
         before I left, but stopped outside and spoke to <font xmlns="" color="blue">my chauffeur</font>;
         we came out later.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE:  </strong>No one else except <font xmlns="" color="blue">Henry Peavey</font> was there?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NORMAND:  </strong>That was all<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""> NANCE:  </strong>What time was it you say you left him--drove away from <font xmlns="" color="green">his
            place</font>?<br/>
            <strong xmlns="">NORMAND: </strong> I left him <font xmlns="" color="green">on the sidewalk</font> about <font xmlns="" color="orange">a quarter to
            eight</font>.<br/>
            <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Did you expect to see him or hear from him later <font xmlns="" color="orange">that evening</font>?<br/>
            <strong xmlns="">NORMAND:  </strong>Yes, he said--he had finished his dinner--he said would I go out and take dinner
         with him and I said, "no;" I was tired; I had to go home and get up
         very early; he said he would call me up in <font xmlns="" color="orange">about an hour.</font><br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Did he call you?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NORMAND: </strong>No, I went to bed; if he called me I was asleep; when I am asleep he tells
         <font xmlns="" color="blue">my maid</font> not to disturb me.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Was that the last time you saw him when you left him about <font xmlns="" color="orange">a quarter to
            eight</font>?<br/>
            <strong xmlns="">NORMAND: </strong>That was the last time.<br/>
            <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Have you any questions, Gentlemen? That is all, you may be excused.<br/>
            <p>I hereby certify that I, as shorthand reporter, correctly took down in shorthand
         the testimony and proceedings had at the within named Coroner's inquest; that the
         foregoing is a full, true and correct copy of my shorthand notes and a full, true
         and correct statement of the testimony and pro- ceedings had at said inquest. E.M.
