      <h2>Witness Statement Provided by MISS MARY MILES MINTER<font xmlns="" color="orange">February 7, 1922 </font><font xmlns="" color="pink">DISTRICT ATTORNEY</font></h2>
      <hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Tess Greenspan</font></h3><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Well, I didn't have any more to say to him. I was just furious; I was furious
         with him; and finally he talked and he said, more, more, more personal things
         about, "You know <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font> that I care for you." </br><br><strong xmlns=""> DORAN:  </strong> He told you he loved you, did he? </br><br><strong xmlns=""> MINTER:  </strong> Yes; he did on <font xmlns="" color="orange"> Friday night.</font>  He said,  "You know I care for you deeply."  I said,
         "I don't care; I don't want you to care for me; I don't want John Jones to care
         for me or anybody; I don't want ever to be in love again as long as I live; I
         don't want to see any man; I hate men."   I probably raved on. I dont know what more
         I can tell you. I was so tired, exhausted; I had been sitting up all night. This
         conversation didn't come as quickly as I am te11ing it to you. It came with long
         pauses; he would get up and walk around with his <font xmlns="" color="purple">cigarette</font> smoking and come back
         again and go out and talk to the property man, go out of <font xmlns="" color="green">the office</font>, and I would
         sit there alone and I tore a <font xmlns="" color="purple">piece of paper</font>, I was so tired, and suggested that we
         go<font xmlns="" color="green"> home</font>. I said,  "Why keep sitting up? You have got to get up at <font xmlns="" color="orange"> eight o'clock in
            the morning </font>  and it is nearly dawn."  He aaid,  "I am worried about this thing; I
         want to find out what you know about this murder."  Then it developed that <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall</font>
         thought I knew something about it, and he looked at me and he said,  "Now,<font xmlns="" color="blue"> Mary"</font> --
         he got a little profane, he said,  "Now, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary,</font> for God's sake, if you know anything
         about the murder of <font xmlns="" color="blue"> Bill </font> tell it to me now."  He said,  "Don't withhold anything."  
         This was too much; not only had he been telling me these things about <font xmlns="" color="blue"> Mr Taylor,</font>
         but there he sat evidently believing that I knew someth1ng. I said, "Do you think
         that I killed <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Taylor? </font> " He said,  "Oh, no; don't be silly. Now is no time to talk
         things like that. " He said,  "I am just trying to find something out about this.
         This is going to be an awful affair."  I said,  "I didn't kill <font xmlns="" color="blue"> William Desmond
            Taylor </font> and I don't know who murdered him." He said,  "You don't? You don't know
         anything?"   He said,  "Of course, you didn't kill him; of course, you didn't put
         anybody on to do it, But"  he said,  "don't you know somebody, don't you know some
         intiÂ­mate details that other people might not know? Can't you rack your brain and
         think who would have a motive for killing him?"  Then he sat there and we said
         words about pro and con, trying to think, and I thought over everyrody I knew and
         I said this, more or less in a humourous way, I said,  "The only person I know who
         could have had a possible motive for killing him would be <font xmlns="" color="blue"> Mrs. Julia Crawford 
            Ivers."</font> I was not serious when I said that. I was more or less humorous. She is a
         lady I feel I ought to explain about, who has never done me a wrong thing in her
         life and I have never done her a wrong thing, either, but she is a Christian
         Science lady who has been associated with him as a scenario writer for many years;
         she is quite a trusted, lovely woman, I am sure; a very honorable respectable
         woman, but we don't like eaeh other. There is no reason, but we don't like each
         other. Every time I wanted to see him, somehow she would be there and she had a
         strange way of treating me. She would say, Oh yes, there is <font xmlns="" color="blue">little Mary.</font> Here she
         comes." She would go on in this manner,  "Oh, there is <font xmlns="" color="blue">little Mary</font> again, Oh, there
         she is; wbat can she be want1ng this time? Oh, yes, uh huh."  Quite a strange
         attitude, She just riled me. </br><br><strong xmlns=""> DORAN:  </strong> How old a woman was she? </br><hr />
