      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Bennett Smart</font></h3><br><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Please state your name.<br/>
      <strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong><font xmlns="" color="blue">Henry Peavey</font>.<br/>
      <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Where do you live?<br/>
      <strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>I live at <font xmlns="" color="green">127 1/2 East 3rd Street.</font><br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>What is your occupation?<br/>
      <strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>Cook and valet.<br/>
      <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong><font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Peavey</font>, were you employed by
         <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font>, the deceased in this
         case?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>Sir?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Were you employed by the dead man in the case?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>Yes,sir.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>How long have you been working for <font xmlns="" color="blue">him?</font><br/>
         <strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>About <font xmlns="" color="orange">six months</font>.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Were you in the <font xmlns="" color="purple">house</font> on the
         evening when <font xmlns="" color="blue">he</font> was found dead
         there?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>Yes, sir.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>What time did you leave the <font xmlns="" color="purple">house</font>?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>I figured it was about <font xmlns="" color="orange">a quarter past [seven]</font> that I left the
         house.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Where was <font xmlns="" color="blue">he</font> when you left?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong><font xmlns="" color="blue">He</font> was sitting in a <font xmlns="" color="purple">chair</font> facing ust to the [illegible] now, and
         <font xmlns="" color="blue">Miss Normand</font> was sitting in a
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">chair</font> just the same. They were
         discussing a <font xmlns="" color="purple">red-backed book</font>.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>In what part of the <font xmlns="" color="purple">house</font> were
         they?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>They were near the <font xmlns="" color="green">dining-room</font>, where you enter the
         <font xmlns="" color="green">dining-room</font> from the
         <font xmlns="" color="green">living-room</font>.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>That is a <font xmlns="" color="purple">two-story apartment</font>, is
         it not?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>Yes, sir.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>And on the <font xmlns="" color="green">ground floor</font>, how many rooms?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>The <font xmlns="" color="green">living-room</font>, <font xmlns="" color="green">dining-room</font> and
         <font xmlns="" color="green">kitchen</font>.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Now, the <font xmlns="" color="green">entrance</font> to this <font xmlns="" color="purple">apartment</font> is immediately into the <font xmlns="" color="green">front</font>
         there, is it not-the <font xmlns="" color="green">front room</font>, rather?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>The <font xmlns="" color="green">front room</font>, yes sir.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>They were seated?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>Near the <font xmlns="" color="green">dining-room</font> there, in the
         <font xmlns="" color="green">living-room</font>, near the <font xmlns="" color="green">entrance to the
            dining-room</font>.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>When you went out, which way did you go out, at the <font xmlns="" color="green">front</font>
         or the <font xmlns="" color="green">back</font>?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>I went out the front way. I always lock up the <font xmlns="" color="purple">back
            door</font> when I go out. I always lock the <font xmlns="" color="purple">back door screen</font>; it has a <font xmlns="" color="purple">hook</font> on the <font xmlns="" color="green">inside</font>. I used the front door
         to come out all the time.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Did you carry the <font xmlns="" color="purple">back door key</font>
         with you?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>No, sir. I always turn it in the <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font>
         and leave it just as it is.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Now, when did you next see <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr.
            Taylor</font>?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>The <font xmlns="" color="orange">next morning</font>, when I went to work.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>What time are you in the habit of coming to work?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>I am usually there about <font xmlns="" color="orange">half past seven</font>.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>What time did you arrive there the next morning?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>just about <font xmlns="" color="orange">half past seven</font>.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>What day was that?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong><font xmlns="" color="orange">Thursday morning [February 2]</font>.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>On arriving there, what did you do?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>I picked up the <font xmlns="" color="purple">paper</font> first; I
         stopped in a <font xmlns="" color="green">drug store</font> at the <font xmlns="" color="green">corner of 5th and
            Los Angeles</font> to get a <font xmlns="" color="purple">bottle of
            medicine</font> - <font xmlns="" color="purple">milk of
            magnesia</font>, <font xmlns="" color="blue">he</font> usually
         takes that every morning; I bought that on my way out. I picked up the
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">paper</font> and unlocked the <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font>. The first thing I saw was his <font xmlns="" color="purple">feet</font>. I looked at his <font xmlns="" color="purple">feet</font> a few minutes and said, "<font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font>."<font xmlns="" color="blue">He</font> never moved. I stepped a little
         further in the <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font>, and seen his <font xmlns="" color="purple">face</font>, and turned and ran out and hollered.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Who did you summon? Who did you call to?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>I don't know.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>You just made a lot of noise to attract all the attention you could?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>Yes, sir.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Several people came, did they?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>Yes, sir. I think <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Desmond</font> [sic], and <font xmlns="" color="blue">the
            gentleman</font> who owns the <font xmlns="" color="purple">court</font> was the first.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>You mean <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Jessurun?</font><br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>Yes, sir.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Who else came?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>And Mr. - you see, I don't know their names - I just seen them - the two
         gentlemens <font xmlns="" color="green">next door</font>, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr.
            MacLean</font> and Mr. - I can't think of the other gentleman's name -
         right <font xmlns="" color="green">next door</font> to us [<font xmlns="" color="blue">Charles Maigne</font>].</br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Christian Tait</font></h3><br><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>You didn't come back there after you had gone away, when <font xmlns="" color="blue">Miss
            Normand</font> was there with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor?</font><br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>No, sir.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>When you went out, was anybody around the place?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>Only <font xmlns="" color="blue">Miss Normand's</font>chauffeur; he had his lights all on inside the
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">limousine</font>, cleaning it. I hit him on the back and
         stopped and talked to him a few minutes.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>When you first opened the <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font>, did you see any
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">furniture</font> overturned, or any sign of a disturbance in
         the <font xmlns="" color="green">house</font>?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>Nothing more than a <font xmlns="" color="purple">chair</font> that was sitting next to the
         wall had been pushed out a little bit and his feet was under this chair. The rest
         of the furniture around the house and room upstairs was just as I left them when I
         went away that <font xmlns="" color="orange">evening</font>.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>And did you notice whether anything had been taken off of his body, or not - any
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">jewelry?</font><br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>I didn't notice that; I didn't touch him at all.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Do you know whether he wore any valuable <font xmlns="" color="purple">jewelry?</font><br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>Yes sir, he had a <font xmlns="" color="purple">wrist watch</font> and another watch with a
         lot of little trinkets on; and a thing you stamp checks with to keep anybody from
         making the checks any big- ger, and a <font xmlns="" color="purple">lead pencil</font>.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Did he have a <font xmlns="" color="purple">diamond ring</font>?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>Yes sir, he had a large <font xmlns="" color="purple">diamond ring</font> that he wore.<br/><strong xmlns=""> NANCE:  </strong>Do you know whether he had it on that <font xmlns="" color="orange">evening?</font><br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>Yes sir, he was dressed just as when I went that evening, as I found him the
         <font xmlns="" color="orange">next morning</font>.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Was the ring on his finger the <font xmlns="" color="orange">next morning</font>?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>Yes sir, his other jewelry that I had put away the <font xmlns="" color="orange">night before</font> was
         just as I had put it away up in the dresser drawer.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>You didn't find anything taken from the <font xmlns="" color="green">apartment</font>?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>No sir, it was just as when I left it when I found it. The rug was a little bit
         kicked up. It looked like he had kicked it with his foot.<br/><strong xmlns=""> NANCE: </strong>There was no other disturbance there?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>No, sir. Even the <font xmlns="" color="purple">living-room table</font> that I had moved
         aside. The <font xmlns="" color="purple">rocking chair</font> would hit the table, and I moved
         the table so the rocking chair would not hit the table. It was just as I left
         it.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>By a juror: Were any of the <font xmlns="" color="purple">windows</font> up at night?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>No sir, we had those little long pins that runs in the windows. The windows
         upstairs in his <font xmlns="" color="green">bedroom</font> were up. The windows downstairs I
         always locked with this peg that slipped in the
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">window</font>.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Were they still that way in the <font xmlns="" color="orange">morning</font>?<br/><strong xmlns="">PEAVEY: </strong>They were still that way in the morning. The lights were burning just as I had
         left them that <font xmlns="" color="orange">night</font>; two lights, one in the living-room and one in
         the dining-room.<br/><strong xmlns="">CORONER: </strong>That is all, you may be excused.</br>I hereby certify that I, as shorthand reporter, correctly took down in shorthand
