         <br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong><font xmlns="" color="green">425 North Hill.</font><br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>What is your occupation?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>Police officer.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong><font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Ziegler</font>, were you called to the <font xmlns="" color="green">premises</font> when the
         deceased was found dead? <br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>I was.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>When did you arrive there?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>A little before <font xmlns="" color="orange">8 o'clock in the morning</font> of <font xmlns="" color="orange">February 2nd.</font><br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Will you state what you found when you got there?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>I found the deceased, Mr. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor</font>, lying just inside of the <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font>, on his back. His <font xmlns="" color="purple">hands</font>, one of them, apparently to the side of his body, and the other lying outstretched;
         and <font xmlns="" color="purple">blood</font> pouring from his mouth. He was lying with his head to the east, flat on his back,
         dead.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Was his body rigid and cold?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>It was.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Indicating he had been dead for some time?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>Yes, sir.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Did you see any evidence of a disturbance in the <font xmlns="" color="green">house</font>? <br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER </strong>Not any.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Who was there when you arrived there?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>The owner of the <font xmlns="" color="green">building</font>; <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. MacLean</font>; another movie actor <font xmlns="" color="blue">[Charles Maigne]</font>, and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Peavey</font>.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>You mean the owner of the building, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Jessurun</font><br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>Yes, sir, and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. MacLean</font> and another man I don't know.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>One of the adjacent tenants of the building?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>Yes sir,living <font xmlns="" color="green">next door east</font> of <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font>.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Did you question any of those persons as to whether they had heard any gunshot the
         <font xmlns="" color="orange">night previous</font>?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>I did. I learned that from <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs. MacLean</font>, that along about <font xmlns="" color="orange">fifteen or perhaps ten minutes to eight</font>, the night before, she heard a shot. 
         She thought it was a gunshot. She went to her front <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font> and opened the door, and saw a man standing in <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor's</font> door. She looked at him, and he stood and looked at her; and he walked down 
         the steps, turned to the left, and going around the end of the building, which is
         to the east; and out into the street.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Into what <font xmlns="" color="green">street</font>?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>Which is <font xmlns="" color="green">Maryland</font>, I think.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Did <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Jessurun</font> tell you he heard a shot?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>I think he did.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Did he say why he didn't try to investigate it?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>He did not. He didn't know but what it was an <font xmlns="" color="purple">automobile</font> making a noise.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Did <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. MacLean</font> endeavor to investigate it?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>Not that I know of, and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs. MacLean's</font> maid also heard a shot.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Did they say why they didn't attempt to investigate the cause of the shot?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>They did not.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Did you find any weapon about the room where the deceased was lying?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>I found a <font xmlns="" color="purple">weapon</font> in the <font xmlns="" color="green">room above</font>.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Where was it?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>In the <font xmlns="" color="green">front bedroom in the dresser drawer</font>, lying on a sort of <font xmlns="" color="purple">box</font>.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Did you investigate to see whether the <font xmlns="" color="purple">clothing</font> was powder burnt or not?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIELGLER: </strong>I did not. That was investigated, I understand, later.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Did you ask any of the persons who were called by <font xmlns="" color="blue">Henry Peavey</font>, the valet, whether there was any <font xmlns="" color="purple">weapon</font> there when they first came into the room?
         <br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>Yes, sir. We looked for everything of that kind.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Have you formed any conclusion whether it was possible this shot could have been fired
         by the deceased himself?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>Impossible.<br/><strong xmlns="">THE CORONER: </strong>Have you any questions, gentlemen?<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>By a juror: Was the revolver found <font xmlns="" color="green">upstairs</font> loaded?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>It was. It had five <font xmlns="" color="purple">shells</font> in it; it had not been shot of
         late.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Was it the same caliber <font xmlns="" color="purple">bullet</font> as was found on the deceased?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>This was a <font xmlns="" color="purple">.32 automatic Savage</font>.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>In the <font xmlns="" color="purple">drawer</font><font xmlns="" color="green">upstairs</font>?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>Yes.<br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>What was the number of the <font xmlns="" color="purple">bullet</font> that was found?<br/><strong xmlns="">ZIEGLER: </strong>I understand that it was a <font xmlns="" color="purple">.38</font>. I haven't seen it.<br/><strong xmlns="">THE CORONER: </strong>That is all, you may be excused. That is all the <font xmlns="" color="purple">evidence</font> we will take in this case. All but the Jury will be excused.
