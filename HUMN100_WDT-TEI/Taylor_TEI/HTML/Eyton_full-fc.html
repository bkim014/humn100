      <strong xmlns="">EYTON: </strong><font xmlns="" color="blue">Charles Eyton.</font><br/>
      <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Where do you reside?<br/>
      <strong xmlns=""> EYTON: </strong><font xmlns="" color="green">1920 Vine Street, Hollywood.</font><br/>
      <strong xmlns=""> NANCE: </strong>What is your occupation?<br/>
      <strong xmlns="">EYTON: </strong>General Manager, <font xmlns="" color="pink">Famous Players-Lasky
            Corporation.</font><br/>
            <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong><font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Eyton</font>, have you seen the remains of the
         deceased in the adjoining <font xmlns="" color="green">room?</font><br/>
         <strong xmlns=""> EYTON: </strong>Yes, sir.<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""> NANCE: </strong>Do you recognize them as one you knew in life?<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""> EYTON: </strong>Yes, sir.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Who was it.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON: </strong><font xmlns="" color="blue">William Desmond Taylor.</font><br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Where was he born?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON: </strong>He was born in <font xmlns="" color="green">Ireland</font>, to the best of my knowledge. He
         told me so.<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""> NANCE:  </strong>What was his age?<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""> EYTON: </strong>Forty-four, I should judge. [He was forty-nine.] <br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>Was he married, single or a widower?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON: </strong>He was married. [He was divorced as of <font xmlns="" color="orange">1916.</font>]<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""> NANCE: </strong>When did he die?<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""> EYTON: </strong><font xmlns="" color="orange">Thursday morning or Wednesday night</font>. I saw the <font xmlns="" color="purple">body </font>first on <font xmlns="" color="orange">Thursday morning.</font><br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong><font xmlns="" color="orange">Last Thursday?</font><br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON: </strong>Yes, sir.<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""> NANCE: </strong>Do you recall that date?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON: </strong>It was the <font xmlns="" color="orange">2nd.</font><br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong><font xmlns="" color="orange">February 2nd?</font><br/>
         <strong xmlns=""> EYTON: </strong><font xmlns="" color="orange">February 2nd.</font><br/>
         <strong xmlns=""> NANCE: </strong>Where did he die?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON: </strong>the <font xmlns="" color="green">Apartment "B," South Alvarado Street, 404</font> I think it
         was.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong>What was the cause of his death, if you know?<br/><strong xmlns=""> EYTON: </strong>Well, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor's assistant [Harry Fellows]</font>
         rang me up at my <font xmlns="" color="green"> residence </font>about, I should judge, <font xmlns="" color="orange">eight o'clock</font>, and told me <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font> had died suddenly; so I immediately went over to his
         <font xmlns="" color="green"> residence</font>, and he was lying on the <font xmlns="" color="green">floor
            </font> on his back. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Detective Ziegler</font>
         was there and he had called the <font xmlns="" color="blue">doctor</font>, he told
         me, previous to my arrival; and the <font xmlns="" color="blue">doctor</font> told
         me <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font> had died from hemorrhage of the
         stomach. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Maclean</font> - <font xmlns="" color="blue">Douglas Maclean</font> - had told me that he had thought he had heard a
         shot the <font xmlns="" color="orange">night before</font>, and his wife also thought she had heard a shot
         - and he wanted the <font xmlns="" color="purple">body</font> turned over; they didn't want to
         turn it over until <font xmlns="" color="blue">the coroner</font> came. <font xmlns="" color="blue">The deputy coroner</font> came after a while, and he
         told us he had died of hemorrhage of the stomach, and I told him he had better
         turn the <font xmlns="" color="purple">body</font> over to make sure, and he put his hand
         under <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor's</font> body, and found a little -
         when he pulled his hand out, it had a little blood on his hand. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Douglas</font> asked him what that was, and he said it
         evidently had run down from his [<font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor's</font>]
         mouth, but I noticed that there was no trail of blood-<font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr.
            Taylor's</font> head was in a pool of blood - there was no trail of blood
         running down.<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""> NANCE: </strong>There was a pool of blood <font xmlns="" color="green">under his head?</font><br/><strong xmlns=""> EYTON:  </strong>Under his head, yes, a little pool of blood. I immediately opened up <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor's</font><font xmlns="" color="purple">vest</font>, and looked, and looked on the
         right-hand side, and there was no mark. I looked on the left-hand side and saw
         some blood, and then I told the <font xmlns="" color="blue">Deputy Coroner</font>
         that I thought that evidence enough to turn his <font xmlns="" color="purple">body</font> over
         to see what would happen. I sent for a <font xmlns="" color="purple">pillow</font>to put under <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr.
            Taylor's</font> head, and we turned him over - the <font xmlns="" color="blue">Deputy Coroner</font> and myself - and we pulled his
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">shirt</font> and his <font xmlns="" color="purple">vest</font> up, and we found the <font xmlns="" color="purple">bullet wound.</font><br/><strong xmlns="">NANCE: </strong><font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Eyton</font>, was his <font xmlns="" color="purple">body</font> stone cold
         at that time?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON: </strong>Stone cold and very stiff and rigid.<br/>
         <hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Elizabeth Settle</font></h3><br/>
      <strong xmlns="">NANCE </strong>Indicating that it had been dead for some time?<br/>
      <strong xmlns="">EYTON </strong>Yes.<br/>
      <strong xmlns="">NANCE </strong>Where was the body lying with reference to the front entrance to his home?<br/>
      <strong xmlns="">EYTON </strong>It was lying right in front of a little <font xmlns="" color="purple">desk</font> with the head pointed east and the
         feet pointed west. I should judge the feet were three or four feet from the door -
         the front entrance.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE </strong>Who were present when you was there?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON </strong>When I came in, the first man I noticed was <font xmlns="" color="blue">Detective Ziegler</font>, whom I have known
         for a number of years, and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Douglas Maclean</font>; <font xmlns="" color="blue">Charles Maigne</font>; the landlord [E. C.
         Jessurun]; and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Harry Fellows</font>, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor's</font> assistant director.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE </strong>Did all of these persons live there in this <font xmlns="" color="green">neighborhood?</font><br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON </strong>That I could not tell you. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. MacLean</font> did, I know, because he showed me where his <font xmlns="" color="green">apartment</font>
         was.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE </strong>The place <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font> lived was in a <font xmlns="" color="green">court?</font><br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON </strong>In a <font xmlns="" color="green">court</font>, yes.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE </strong>These other <font xmlns="" color="green">buildings</font> were nearby?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON </strong>There are several <font xmlns="" color="green">apartments</font> in this <font xmlns="" color="green">court</font>, all the way around.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE </strong>Did Mr. and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs. MacLean</font>, or either of them, tell you about
         the <font xmlns="" color="orange">hour</font> that they heard the gunshot?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON </strong>Yes, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Maclean</font> told me it was about <font xmlns="" color="orange">eight
            or a quarter after eight</font>, and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs. Maclean</font> thought it was a little later. [This is not
         correct.]<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE </strong>That <font xmlns="" color="orange">night?</font><br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON </strong>Yes, the night before.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE </strong>You didn't make any definite measurements as to the position of the body?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON </strong>No, sir.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE </strong>So that what you testified to is only an estimate, and nothing definite about it.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON </strong>Yes.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE </strong>Now, how long has <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font> lived in this place?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON </strong>That I could not tell you. He lived in it before he went to the war, I believe.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE </strong>When did you last see him alive?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON </strong>The same day - <font xmlns="" color="orange">Wednesday</font><br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE </strong>Now, did he have any <font xmlns="" color="purple">fire-arms</font> of his own?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON </strong>I believe he had a <font xmlns="" color="purple">revolver</font>; I believe the <font xmlns="" color="purple">revolver</font> was in the <font xmlns="" color="purple">upper drawer</font><font xmlns="" color="green">upstairs</font>; in fact, I know there was, because <font xmlns="" color="blue">Detective Ziegler</font> and myself went up there and saw it. <br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE </strong>When you were called to this place, did you see any <font xmlns="" color="purple">fire-arms</font> in this room where he was?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON </strong>No.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE </strong>What is the name of his valet, or attendant there?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON </strong><font xmlns="" color="blue">Harry Peavey</font>, the colored cook. I never knew him or saw him.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE </strong>Was he the one who called you?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON </strong><font xmlns="" color="blue">Harry Fellows</font>, his assistant director, was the one who called me.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">NANCE </strong>You have no independent knowledge of the manner in which he met his death?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON </strong>No, sire.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">THE CORONER </strong>Have you any questions, gentlemen?<br/>
         (Question By a Juror) Was his <font xmlns="" color="purple">clothing</font> ruffled in any way, showing any violence?<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">EYTON </strong>No, absolutely none; it looked like he just walked in the door and was shot in the
         back; that is the way it looked. It didn't show evidence in the room when I got there-
         neither the room or the body showed any evidence of a struggle. He had on the same
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">suit</font> as when I seen him the day before when he talked to me.<br/>
         <strong xmlns="">THE CORONER </strong>Is there any other questions? That is all, you may be excused.
