      <h2>Witness Statement Provided by Mrs. Faith MacLean<font xmlns="" color="orange">2-9-22</font><font xmlns="" color="pink">Police</font></h2>
      <hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Christine</font></h3><br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>When did you first learn that <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font> was dead?<br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong><font xmlns="" color="orange">7:30</font><font xmlns="" color="orange">Thursday morning</font>.<br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>Who was it that brought it to your attention?<br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>His colored servant came screaming out of the house.<br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>What did he say?<br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>"Help, Police, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font> is dead."<br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>Did the fact that <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font> was dead remind you of anything that occurred <font xmlns="" color="orange">the night before</font> *  did you hear a shot.<br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>Yes, what we thought might be a <font xmlns="" color="purple">shot</font> or a muffler explosion, I do not know which.<br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>When did you hear that?<br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>Sometime probably <font xmlns="" color="orange">between quarter of eight and eight o'clock</font> on <font xmlns="" color="orange">Wednesday evening</font>.<br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>Now, at the time you heard this <font xmlns="" color="purple">shot</font> did you go out on the <font xmlns="" color="purple">porch</font><br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>Yes, shortly after *** oh, about, I suppose three or four seconds, maybe a minute.<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>No I did not I just opened my front <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font>.<br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>Well, what did you say?<br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>I saw e man had already opened the <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font> of <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font>'s <font xmlns="" color="purple">house</font> and was looking towards <font xmlns="" color="green">Alverado St.</font> *** I didn't see him open the <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font>; it was already open I think.<br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>Which way was the screen?<br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>The screen <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font> was open. I think the screen <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font> was open then I must have been to have seen his figure as clearly as I did.<br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>Did he shut the <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font>?<br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>It seems like he shut the <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font>. It seems like he leaned in and pulled it closed. So it must have been opened because
         I distinctly saw his <font xmlns="" color="purple">cap</font>.<br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>You are satisfied are you, that the light came from <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor's</font> apartment out on the street through the open door?<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>Yes.<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>Did he seem in a hurry?<br/>
      <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>No, he was the coolest thing I have ever seen * * *. He turned around and looked at
         me and hesitated. Then it seems as if * * * that <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font> must have spoken to him from inside the house *** he thought he had spoken and he
         didn't. Seemed like he pulled the <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font> shut, then turned around and looking at me all the time, walked down a couple ot
         steps that go up to <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor's</font> house there.<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>Do you know whether the man that you saw went to <font xmlns="" color="green">Alvarado St.</font> through the open court there?<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>He went towards <font xmlns="" color="green">Maryland St.</font> and towards the alley in between the two houses because he was facing that way ready
         to go when I closed the <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font>.<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>You knew it wasn't <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor</font>.<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>Oh, I knew it wasn't <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor</font>.<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>Could you have recognized the man 1f it had been <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font>.<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>Oh, yes, positively.<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>Now, is it possible that it might have been this young man <font xmlns="" color="blue">Howard Fellows</font>, the chauffeur, that you saw there. Could that be possible.<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>I suppose it could be possible but it doesn't seem to me that he was the boy or was
         the man. He doesn't seem the built of that man.<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>Did the man you saw have a <font xmlns="" color="purple">smooth face</font>?<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>Yes, he did have a <font xmlns="" color="purple">smooth face</font>.<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>Did the man you saw have on anything like a chauffeur's uniform?<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>Well, the only thing I noticed was his <font xmlns="" color="purple">cap</font>, something tied around his <font xmlns="" color="purple">throat</font>. I don't know whether the man had an <font xmlns="" color="purple">over-coat</font> or not.<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>His age I don't know but I should judge the man was probably between 30 and 35. He
         was about 5 feet nine, just about ***, and he was stocky, not fat, but stocky. He
         had on a <font xmlns="" color="purple">cap</font>. It seemed like a checked <font xmlns="" color="purple">cap</font> with a plaid in it, and he wore something around his <font xmlns="" color="purple">throat</font>.<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong><font xmlns="" color="purple">Smooth shaven</font>?<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>Yes.<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>Color of his <font xmlns="" color="purple">suit</font>?<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>No, except it was a dark <font xmlns="" color="purple">suit</font>.<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>Now didn't compare in size with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Smith</font>, the reporter here, who is taking this statement? (<font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Smith</font> was about 5' 7 1/2")<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>No, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Smith</font> is shorter.<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>NARRATOR </strong>(The witness names the following men: <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Henry King</font>, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Mahlon Hamilton</font>, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Arthur Hoyt</font>, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Berris (first name Nigle?)</font>, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Ince</font>, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Marshal Neilan</font>. Witness was then asked the following questions)<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue"></font>POLICE </strong>Now then, tell me whether there is any possibility that this man you saw coming out
         of there was any of the persons that you have mentioned?<br/>
         <strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">Faith MacLean</font> </strong>No, I think not. I think I would have recognized any of those people.** when he came out he was dressed as my idea of a moving picture burglar**? ** because
         I remember thinking perhaps he might have been one of the boys in <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor's</font> company when they go out on location. Not well dressed. I don't know as I would say
         slovenly but I don't think he was well dressed.
