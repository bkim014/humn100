      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Ellie Luciani</font></h3><br><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>During the time in <font xmlns="" color="green">the east</font> there, when he <font xmlns="" color="blue">(Taylor)</font> was directing her
         <font xmlns="" color="blue">(Mary)</font>, did you observe any awakening of a friendship or
         love between the two of them?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong> No.<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>When did you first see that, or did you at all?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>I never did know it, Mr. Keyes, until <font xmlns="" color="blue"> Mr.
            Mott</font> told me of the <font xmlns="" color="purple">letters</font> that had been found in <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor's</font><font xmlns="" color="purple"> drawer</font> that absolutely is convincing that there had been
         something there.<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>You mean after he was killed?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>Yes, and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr Eyton</font> told me also after <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr.
            Taylor</font> was killed that he knew that, that he knew for a long time
         that <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font> and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font> had been
         intimate, and I said then "<font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Eyton</font> you should have
         told me"<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>During that time, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs. Shelby</font> (referring to latter part of
         <font xmlns="" color="orange">1919</font> and early part of <font xmlns="" color="orange">1920</font>), was
         <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font> going around with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor</font> to your
         knowledge at all?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>Why no, and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font> was the most perfectly poised man,
         such a proper man. He would take <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font> out to dinner and he
         would invariably invite me and my mother to go to dinner with them.<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Did you make any objections?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong> Not the least in the world.<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Were you friendly with him?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>Oh, yes. **<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Do you remember anyone in particular with whom she was associating at that
         time?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>It wasn't men. Men hadn't begun to give me any trouble at that time. It was
         women.<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Who was that?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong><font xmlns="" color="blue">Jeannie McPherson.</font><br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong><font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor's</font> name never entered into the discussion then?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>No. I always felt that, when <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font> was out with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr.
            Taylor</font> she was under a good influence. **<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Did you ever have any words with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font> over
         <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font>?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>Never a word, never the slightest word. (Speaking of the time <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs.
            Shelby</font> went to <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor's</font><font xmlns="" color="green">home</font> at <font xmlns="" color="orange">2 a.m.</font> looking for
         <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font>) <br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Did this secretary of yours, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Miss Whitney</font>, go in the
         <font xmlns="" color="green">house</font> with you?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>No, I know she didn't because there was nobody in the <font xmlns="" color="green">room</font>
         but <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font> and me. She stayed in the
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">car</font>.<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Did you have any <font xmlns="" color="purple">weapon</font> with you at that time?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>Good lord, no.<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>You are sure you didn't have a <font xmlns="" color="purple">revolver</font> with you?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>No, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Keyes.</font><br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Well, you owned a <font xmlns="" color="purple">revolver</font> at that time?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong> No. If I owned a <font xmlns="" color="purple">revolver</font> at that time, I don't know
         where it was. It was thrown away.<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>What date was it when you were at <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor's</font> home that you
         were telling about?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>I think I could almost fix that date, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Keyes</font>, referring
         to a certain little <font xmlns="" color="purple">book</font>, you know. Because I was reading
         <font xmlns="" color="blue"> Mary's</font><font xmlns="" color="purple">diary</font> and she goes on to say in this
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">diary</font> that she and I had some little words that
         <font xmlns="" color="orange">evening</font>, you see, and she has written it very cleverly, about the
         small girl going out in a huff, etc., and she adds that mother was right. ** And I
         think the date of that happening is right in her
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">diary</font>.<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Did you ever make a threat to kill <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor?</font><br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>No, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Keyes.</font> I never had any reason or desire to kill
         <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor.</font><br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>And you are positive, are you,<font xmlns="" color="blue"> Mrs. Shelby</font>, that you never
         at any time threatened <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor?</font><br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>Certainly not, I had no reason. I never threatened to shoot <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr.
            Taylor</font>. I don't think I ever threatened to shoot any man.<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>To shoot him? No, because I had no reason. I had no provocation. I never had a
         quarrel with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font> in my life.<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>You spoke of having thrown a <font xmlns="" color="purple">gun</font> away?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>No, my mother did that.<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>That was your <font xmlns="" color="purple">gun</font>?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>The <font xmlns="" color="purple">gun</font> was given to me in <font xmlns="" color="green">Santa
            Barbara</font> by <font xmlns="" color="blue">Harry Eaves</font>, who has a
         <font xmlns="" color="green">jewelry shop</font> up there - a very short little
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">pistol</font> - a little <font xmlns="" color="purple">automatic</font> -
         ** and he said to me, "I have got two and you ought to have
         one."<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Where did you say you shot it once?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>I got a friend of mine to take me out in <font xmlns="" color="green">Santa Barbara</font>,
         just off the <font xmlns="" color="purple">road</font>, and we shot it into a
         <font xmlns="" color="green">bank</font> and I shot it once.</br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Patrick Mannion</font></h3><br><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Did you ever do any target practice with it?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>Yes, that one <font xmlns="" color="orange">time</font>. It was enough for <font xmlns="" color="blue">me</font>. The
         thing was too short. <font xmlns="" color="blue">I</font> can shoot a <font xmlns="" color="purple">long
            pistol</font>. <font xmlns="" color="blue">I</font> wouldn't mind shooting a
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">shot gun.</font> **<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong> Well, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs. Shelby</font>, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font> shot that
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">pistol</font> off one <font xmlns="" color="orange">time</font>, didn't
         <font xmlns="" color="blue">she</font>?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>Yes, she shot it off twice.<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Was that the "suicide"?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>That's the "suicide". (re supposed suicide) "Well, we were living at
         <font xmlns="" color="green">56 Fremont Place. </font> ** I remember the
         secretary was there that <font xmlns="" color="orange">night</font>,
         <font xmlns="" color="blue">Miss Whitney.</font> ** <font xmlns="" color="blue">She (Mary)</font> rushed up
         the <font xmlns="" color="purple">steps</font> crying "I am going to end it all. I am going to
         end it all." ** Then <font xmlns="" color="blue">Charlotte (Miss Whitney)</font> said to me,
         "Mes. Shelby, oh, Mrs. Shelby, there's a <font xmlns="" color="purple">pistol</font> in your
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">closet</font>." ** But she ran up the
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">stairs</font> and ran in my room and closed the
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font>.<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong> Did she look the <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font>?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>Oh, locked the <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font>, and the first thing we knew - bang.
         ** and a second more and - bang - the second shot. ** <font xmlns="" color="blue">The
            chauffeur (Chauncey Eaton)</font> appeared, and the
         <font xmlns="" color="blue">night watchman</font> (?), and I said, "Break in the door". The
         two men rushed against the <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font>, the <font xmlns="" color="purple">door</font> fell in, and there lay <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font> on my
         bedroom floor. ** They picked her up so tenderly, and
         <font xmlns="" color="blue">Chauncey</font> turned her over and he said, "Why, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs.
            Shelby</font>, there is no blood on her." ** By that time the
         <font xmlns="" color="blue">secretary</font> had faded out of the picture in a faint ** and
         she (<font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs. Shelby's mother, Mrs. Miles</font>) said,"Why no, she is
         not shot; stand her up, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Chauncey</font>." ** Then she
         (<font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font>) looked at us and said, "I thought I would give you
         all a jolt."<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>** was there anything said about <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor</font> in that? Did he have
         anything to do with that quarrel?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>No, I don't think he had anything to do with that ** I may have asked her if she
         had been out with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font>.<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>But there was no quarrel about <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font>?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>It seems to me she mentioned <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor's</font> name. I don't remember
         now, or what. **<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>Then the <font xmlns="" color="purple">report</font> that I got that you have been practicing
         some <font xmlns="" color="purple">revolver</font> shooting - is there anything to that?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>I told you I shot it once. I know a man who will verify it - <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr.
            Stockdale</font>.<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong> No other <font xmlns="" color="purple">pistol</font> at any other <font xmlns="" color="orange">time</font>?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>No, I am afraid of <font xmlns="" color="purple">pistols</font>. **<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>What did your <font xmlns="" color="blue">mother</font> do with your
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">pistol</font> after <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font> pulled this
         stunt?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>That was all there was to it. Of course, we found <font xmlns="" color="blue">Charlotte
            Whitney</font> in a faint on the <font xmlns="" color="green">floor</font> and we had to
         revive her. ** And <font xmlns="" color="blue">Chauncey</font> was trying to find out where the
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">bullets</font> went, and we discovered one
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">bullet</font> had been shot into my
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">closet</font>, and we found that, and another one went up in
         the ceiling of the <font xmlns="" color="purple">closet</font>. I remember
         <font xmlns="" color="blue">mother</font> taking the <font xmlns="" color="purple">pistol</font>. She
         said, "Here, give me that. That's enough of <font xmlns="" color="purple">pistols</font> lying
         around."<br/><strong xmlns="">POLICE: </strong>What did she do with it?<br/><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>I never saw it again. I think I asked her once or twice what she did with it, and
         she said,"It's out. It's put away."</br> ---<br><strong xmlns="">MRS. SHELBY: </strong>I had an engagement with a man the <font xmlns="" color="orange">next morning (2-2-22) at 9
            o'clock</font>. *** This man was a client of a friend of my daughter's,
         <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Albert Reiner.</font> *** I also had been talking to a man
         about buying an <font xmlns="" color="purple">Aeolian Organ</font>, and he stopped 1n<font xmlns="" color="orange">
            that morning</font> And while these two men were in the room, the
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">telephone</font> rang. It was then a <font xmlns="" color="orange">little after
            9</font>, and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Carl Stockdale</font> called me up. He had gone
         to the <font xmlns="" color="green">studio</font> to work and had learned of the death of
         <font xmlns="" color="blue">William Desmond Taylor</font>. Naturally, knowing that he
         directed <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font>, he called me up and told me that
         <font xmlns="" color="blue">William Desmond Taylor</font> bad been found dead that
         <font xmlns="" color="orange">morning</font>.</br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Jack Murphy</font></h3><br><strong xmlns=""><font color="pink">POLICE</font> </strong>Just what did he tell you?<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">MRS. SHELBY</font> </strong>He said, "<font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs. Shelby</font>, I just wanted to call you
         up and tell you. I am at the <font xmlns="" color="green">studio</font>. <font xmlns="" color="blue">William Desmond Taylor</font> was found dead <font xmlns="" color="orange">this morning</font>."
         "Oh," I said, "that's terrible." That's all he knew. ** I turned to these gentlemen
         and said, "Oh, my, it's terrible. A man who directed <font xmlns="" color="blue">my
            daughter</font>, a very charming gentleman, was found dead <font xmlns="" color="orange">this
            morning</font>." ** In a few minutes the <font xmlns="" color="purple">telephone</font> rang again. ** This time <font xmlns="" color="blue">Miss
            Berger</font> said, "<font xmlns="" color="blue">William Desmond Taylor</font>
         was murdered this morning. He was shot." I said, "Oh, my, this is terrible; the man
         was murdered? Was shot?" So we discussed that and the organ man knew I was waiting
         to
         go out with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Rice</font> so ** <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr.
            Rice</font> and I got in his <font xmlns="" color="purple">car</font> **
         and I said, "<font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Rice</font>, do you mind if I stop at my
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">house</font> and tell my people?" ** and it seems to me that on
         the way crossing <font xmlns="" color="green">Vermont</font> I met my mother coming over in a
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">car</font> with the <font xmlns="" color="blue">chauffeur</font> and I just waved to her to turn around and come on back with
         us. I remember that distinctly. ** I was in a great hurry because <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Rice</font> was waiting for me in front, and I remember the
         chauffeur had parked my <font xmlns="" color="purple">blue Packard</font> in the
         <font xmlns="" color="green">driveway</font>, and something was said about <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font> wanted the <font xmlns="" color="purple">car</font>. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Chauncey</font> had gone to get
         <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary's</font><font xmlns="" color="purple">car</font>. However, I went
         <font xmlns="" color="green">upstairs</font> in a great hurry, and I said, "Oh, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Julia</font>, dear, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Taylor</font>
         was murdered last night." She said, "Oh, it isn't possible. I can't believe it. It
         isn't true." I said, "Oh, yes, it is. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Miss Berger</font>
         told me so." **<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="pink">POLICE</font> </strong>Did <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Woolwine</font> ever try to take your
         statement?<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">MRS. SHELBY</font> </strong>No, he never asked me a thing, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Keyes</font>. Nobody
         ever questioned me.<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">MR. MOTT</font> </strong> Tell <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Keyes</font> exactly now, that part of the
         conversation with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Chauncey</font>?<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">MRS. SHELBY</font> </strong> I said, "<font xmlns="" color="blue">Chauncey</font>, what did you tell them?" He
         said, "I told them that you called me up very early that morning, about <font xmlns="" color="orange">half
            past seven</font>, and my wife said you went over there without breakfast; that
         you wanted to go over to the <font xmlns="" color="green">Hobart house</font>." I said, "The
         morning of the <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor</font> murder?" He said, "Yes." I
         said, "Why, I couldn't have known until after <font xmlns="" color="orange">9 o'clock</font>." He said that
         he drove me over that morning and said that I was at the window with the <font xmlns="" color="purple">papers</font>. I said, "How could that be; besides
         there wasn't any papers <font xmlns="" color="orange">that morning</font>." "No," he said, "that's what they
         told me down at <font xmlns="" color="green">the office</font>, that there wasn't any <font xmlns="" color="purple">papers</font> that early." I said, "Well, that's
         nothing, it is just a lapse of memory, it is of no consequence." And finally he saw
         he was in the wrong. I explained to him that <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Rice</font>
         had driven me over.<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">MR. MOTT</font> </strong> Now explain that <font xmlns="" color="blue">Monte Blue</font> proposition.<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">MRS. SHELBY</font> </strong> (<font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs. Shelby</font> tells about some night when <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font> had failed to come <font xmlns="" color="green">home</font>, and
         they had looked for her until about <font xmlns="" color="orange">2:30 a.m</font>. and finally located her
         <font xmlns="" color="purple">car</font> in front of <font xmlns="" color="green"><font color="blue">Charlotte Whitney's</font> house</font>) So <font xmlns="" color="blue">Margaret</font> and I rushed in and went up the steps hurriedly
         and opened the door and came upon <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font> and
         <font xmlns="" color="blue">Monte Blue</font> on the couch. The door opened right
         into the <font xmlns="" color="green">front room</font>. This <font xmlns="" color="blue">Monte
            Blue</font> started to run out into the <font xmlns="" color="green">kitchen</font> and out
         the <font xmlns="" color="green">back door</font>.<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="pink">POLICE</font> </strong> You mean that they were in a compromising position?<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">MRS. SHELBY</font> </strong> Yes. I was about the maddest woman that could ever be. I grabbed this halfbreed
         Indian by his shirt tail and I said, "Come right back in <font xmlns="" color="green">this
            room</font>. I have something very forceful to say to you. Come back
         here."<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">MR. DAVIS</font> </strong> That time she went out with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Marshall Neilan</font>,
         after the murder; wasn't that about <font xmlns="" color="orange">two nights afterward</font>?<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">MRS. SHELBY</font> </strong>Yes.<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="pink">POLICE</font> </strong>Immediately afterwards, wasn't it?<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">MRS. SHELBY</font> </strong> It was.<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">MR. KEYES</font> </strong> She tried to kill you, you say?<br/><strong xmlns=""><font color="blue">MRS. SHELBY</font> </strong> Yes. ** Oh, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mary</font> said around the house freely,
         "Oh, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mrs. Shelby</font> killed <font xmlns="" color="blue">Taylor</font>". Not only once but many times. She was
         always saying that.</br><hr />
