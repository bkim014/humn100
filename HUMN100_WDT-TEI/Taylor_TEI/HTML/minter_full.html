      <br xmlns=""></br>G.H BOONE OFFICIAL REPORTER IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, February 7, 1922, at
      five o'clock P.M. 
      <br xmlns=""></br>PRESENT: Mr. W.C. Doran, Deputy District Attorney, Miss Mary Miles Minter, John G.
      Mott, attorney for Miss Minter, and G. H.
      Boone, shorthand reporter. 
      <br xmlns=""></br>Questions by Mr. Doran: 
      <hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: Cade Brennan</h3><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>How long have you known Mr Taylor?</br><br><strong xmlns="">Minter: </strong>Since July of 1919 -- yes, that is correct.</br><br><strong xmlns="">Doran: </strong>He has been your
         director in pictures, has he?</br><br><strong xmlns="">Minter: </strong>Did you have occasion to call on
         him at his
         residence within the last thirty days prior to
         his death? -- approximately thirty days?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Just a moment, will you --</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Let me change the question. When was the last time you called on him at his residence?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER:  </strong>On the 23rd of December.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong>Were you alone at that time or did
         others accompany you to see him? </br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER:  </strong>I was alone. </br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong>Was any one else there?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER:  </strong>no, not a soul. </br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong>Was hisvalet, the colored man, there, do
         you know?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER:  </strong>Not that I know of.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong>Prior to that time, was it your habit to call on him
         at his residence or had it been your habit?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER:  </strong>I couldn't call it a habit, but on
         several occasions I did call upon
         him, though never asÂ·1ate as
         upon this occasion.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong>Now, on this last occasion, what time of the day or
         night was it that you
         called? </br><br><strong xmlns=""> MINTER:  </strong>May l tell this in my own way? </br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong>Yes, I would rather have you tell it in your
         own way, if you will.</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER:  </strong>I am glad to. I am trying to answer as I would in court and 1 don't like to do so.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Just proceed, go ahead and tell it in your own way.</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>I had gone to bed; I hadn't seen Mr Taylor in five months at the time -- three months, I know; three
         months, and I just got to thinking about it and I decided I couldn't stand it any
         longer. I was going to go up and tell him "goodbye. I got up and dressed, went
         down to my grandmother's room and I said, "Mama, I am going over to say 'goodbye'
         to Mr Taylor," and she advised me not to do it. She said it was too late: "Do you
         know it is nearly twelve o'clock?" she said. I said, "Yes, sure, but I just must
         do so," I said, "I realize that this is not the usual thing and I have never been
         there so late, but I must do so, Mama. I am going to give him a letter in whioh I
         have told him 'goodbye,"' She said, "All right, then, if you must. I would get up
         and go with you, but I don't feel well enough," Mama often accompanied me on my
         trips, which were not very many during the entire time that i knew him. So I went
         over there and arrived at five minutes to twelve, I am strange about that, I am
         rather queer about that, I think of the time; every time I was with him I would
         say, "Well, this time yesterday I didn't see him and today I am with him," and
         things like that. So I arrived at five minutes to twelve and left at twenty
         minutes to one, and-- Do you wish me to tell you all that transpired?</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Never mind about that. </br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Did your mother go with you? No;
         Mama is my grandmother.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong>Your grandmother didn't accompany you? </br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER:  </strong>No, she did not. </br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong>Your chauffeur drove you there? </br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>No, I drove myself in my little car, little
         run-about.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong>That was December 23rd? </br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER:  </strong>Yes, December 23rd.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong>When was the last time you saw him prior to that? </br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER:  </strong>I couldn't give you the exact date, but I know it was at least three months and a
         little over; it was over three months. </br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong>See him and meet him, to be with him? </br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER:  </strong>No; no, indeed. I passed him at Lasky Studio when I go over there. Sometimes I
         have seen his car go down Western Avenue, but I hadn't seen him to speak to in
         three months.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong>As I understand it, you were sincerely in love with him?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>That is true.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong>Did you convey that feeling to him?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Absolutely.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong>You told him, did you?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Absolutely. He loved me; he told me so.</br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: Ryan Carroll</h3><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Were you engaged to be married?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>No, we were not.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong> At the time of his death, it was --</br><br><strong xmlns="">MR. MOTT: </strong>Right there at that point you might explain about the rising sun, with reference
         to your engagement. I think that explains the attitude between both of you.</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong> I don't know just which to do, whether to tell you this whole thing, go right
         along and talk. I can easily do that.</br><br><strong xmlns="">MR. MOTT: </strong> He asked if you were engaged to him. Tell him about the "rising sun"
         explanation.</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>I can tell you the whole thing better without being asked.</br><br><strong xmlns="">MR. DORAN: </strong> Yes. Go ahead. and tell us in your own way all about it.</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong> I had always known that this was just an exquisite chapter in my life that must
         necessarily be a brief one: I couldn't bear to part with it; it was just a
         beautiful thing that seldom occurs in the world today as I see it, as it is
         forced upon me. It as simply a beautiful white flame; I met him; I had always been
         a reserved, very retiring young girl, and he was the first man and the only man
         who ever embodied all the glories of manhood in one private body. He represented
         that to me. He never by look, by word or by deed gave me any reason to doubt any
         of my ideals that were placed in him absolutely. At the time our love first
         formulated he said to me, "Mary, this is not right. You are May and I am December,
         and this is not right. I know it is best that we must part." This was at the very
         beginning of it, and I said, "Of course, I don't want to do any immodest or bold
         thing; I couldn't try to withhold a person's love for me who didn't care for me.""
         I said, "I know that you are many years older than I, but I couldn't love anybody
         as I love you. I simply love you." And we did try to part, We tried it again and
         again, and then he would beoome ill. At one time I had almost resolved to see him
         no more, and he was taken ill and nobody else cared, [page 6] really cared whether
         he ate his dinner or whether he dressed warm1y enough, whether he took care of
         himself, and I couldn't bear for him to suffer. It was not only a love of
         sweetheart, but I wanted to be his nurse. I wanted to hold his head when it was
         aching. I wanted him to tell me his mental troubles, his heart troubles, and let
         me soothe them away for him as I would for a little child. I forgot the man's age;
         it meant nothing to me. The only thing I wanted was to serve him as I would have
         served the Lord or a little child, and then it just passed away; for months at a
         time I wouldn't see him and I didn't know why. Finally, I decided there was no
         use; it must come to an end and I went there on the night of the 23d to give him
         this letter telling him "goodbye." I had reason to believe, in the awful
         vernacular of the day, that it was over anyway, but I went there to say "goodbye"
         myself. He said, "It is rather late, isn't it, Mary?" when he opened the door. I
         said, "Yes, but don't you realize that I had to come to see you? You know
         Mama has been sick for three months and you have been ill
         and I have been frightfully worried and you haven't even had the kindness to call
         me to tell me that you were i11 and that I must not expect to see you to tell mo
         that things are all right." I said, "I don't care if you don't wish to see me, because it hurts me, but it wouldn't have
         hurt one-millionth as much if you had just explained to me and not leave me in the
         dark." He said, "Mary I couldn't help it; I couldn't help it and I can't explain it to you." Oh, I don't know! I have told this thing so many times, Mr Doran, that the words
         just - I can't tell it even as it is; I can't even express it to you as it really
         is. There is so much more to it.</br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: Julies Chakos</h3><br><strong xmlns="">MR DORAN </strong>At that time, on December 23d, let's see, he was killed on
         February 1st. Who was directing you then?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER </strong>Why, no one was. I had finished a picture.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN </strong>Who directed the last one?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER </strong>My last director was Frank Urson.
         Mr. Taylor so often, often made the remark to me that he
         wished tbat he were younger; he wanted to be younger. We undoubtedly would have
         been married today and he been younger. He explained our not. being engaged in
         that way. I knew we never could be married; I also knew I never would love for
         another human being in the way I cared for him. So he would say, "You know,
         Mary, to me you are the morning
         sun, bright, beaut1ful, and with the
         world and a futune before you, and I am the setting
         sun, and don't you see, my dear, it simply cannot
         be. I hope tbat doesn't give you the impression that I begged him to
         marry me. I never did in my life. I couldn't do that. I never even called him
         "Billie" in my life. The man was too wonderful for that.
         He was wonderful. I don't care what anybody says or what they prove against him. I
         knew him as the finest thing in the world.</br><br><strong xmlns="">MR MOTT </strong>He as the embodyment of your ideal?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER </strong>Yes, and I can say now that I can't truthfully -- I don't know any of those ugly
         things which have been said about him. I never found him so. He was glorious to
         me.</br><br><strong xmlns="">MR DORAN </strong>I read in the paper where you had been engaged to some
         other man.</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER </strong>To Mr Dickson. That is not entirely true.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN </strong>What is his first name?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER </strong>Thomas Dickson.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN </strong>Someone besides him, a director in the movies.</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER </strong>Marshall Neilan, engaged to him?</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN </strong>Yes, Marshall Neilan. Didn't I read in the
         papers that you had been engaged to him and the
         engagement had been broken off?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER </strong>That is not true. Mr Dickson is the only one to whom I have
         been even remotely engaged, and that was a freak of despondency.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN </strong>What about Marshall Neilan? Were you engaged to him?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER </strong>No.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN </strong>Had you been going with Marshall Neilan during, say the last
         thirty or sixty days prior to Taylor's
         death?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER </strong>Going with him?</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN </strong>Had you been out anywhere with him?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER </strong>Yes; he had been to see me; I had been out with him; I am not sure whether it was
         within the thirty days or not, but in the last two
         months, yes sir; but going with him no more than I had for
         years off and on. Mr Neilan's traits [page 9]
         are well known; he comes to see you, and we are always glad to receive him, but we
         never know how long he is going to stay with us or how long he was going to stay
         with this one or that one. He flits here and there like a swallow. We are all
         charmed with his personality, but don't take him seriously.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN </strong>Has he proposed to you?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER </strong>Must I answer that? Yes, he did.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN </strong>Do you recall approximately when it was?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER </strong>About two months ago.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN </strong>That would take it to December 1st, approximately or in the
         middle of December?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER </strong>Well, I think it was after that, Yes -- No, let me see, December 1st
         -- I wish I could tell you.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN </strong>With reference to this December 23d that you called on
         Taylor, when was it?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER </strong>It as before the 1st of December, I think.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN </strong>Q. Before the 1st of December?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER </strong>Yes; about the last of November.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN </strong>And you, of course, rejected im, I suppose?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER </strong>Yes; that is, I didn't exactly say, "No, I will not marry you." I
         didn't take him seriously. I joked with him at the time.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN </strong>Did he seem to be serious?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER </strong>You never know. I couldn't say whether ee was serious or not. I thought possibly
         he was joking, or had a few cocktails.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN </strong>How many times after that did he mention the subject to you?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER </strong>He didn't mention the subject. "May I marry you" again; he didn't
         say that, but he has been on very friendly terms with me and then suddenly go away
         to San Francisco. and I wouldn't hear from him and I would
         remark, "Isn't that just like Marshall?" and
         thought no more of it.</br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: Claire Chao</h3><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong> Well, but along toward the last thirty days prior to
         Taylor's death, he seemed to be quite devoted to you, did
         he not? </br><br><strong xmlns=""> MINTER: </strong> No; I can't really say that he did. As for being with him, wasn't with him very
         much. </br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong> Didn't you observe in him some jealousy? </br><br><strong xmlns=""> MINTER: </strong> Oh, no; No, I can't say that. He was not jealous of me. He is the least jealous
         man I ever met. He takes life too much -- </br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong> Did he ever say anything to you about Taylor?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong> Yes, we have discussed him many times; he loved him. Marshall
         Neilan loved Mr Taylor. </br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong> Did he ever bring any tales to you for which Taylor was
         supposed to have been responsible! </br><br><strong xmlns=""> MINTER: </strong>Not until recently.</br><br><strong xmlns=""> DORAN:  </strong> When was that?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Last Friday night; whereupon we had a severe
         quarrel. I didn't believe him.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong>Friday night after the killing?</br><br><strong xmlns=""> MINTER:  </strong> Yes.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong> Or before the killing?</br><br><strong xmlns=""> MINTER: </strong> No; after.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong> Did he ever say anything like that to you before the killing?</br><br><strong xmlns=""> MINTER:  </strong> No, indeed he did not; he knew that I loved Mr Taylor and
         he had known it.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong> Did he ever comment on that relation between you and
         Taylor?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong> No, he did not; I wouldn't have permitted him to; and I didn't comment on
         his.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong> I will use the word "quarrel," but that may be
         exaggerated; did you ever quarrel with Neilan over
         Taylor? </br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong> Absolutely not; absolutely not. Marshall is the
         typification of the happy-go-lucky Irish spirit and temperaÂ­ment. He does
         perfectly terrible things to everybody, but everybody loves him. They are always
         glad to see him again. As to harboring any deep-seated malice, I don't believe he
         is capable of it. </br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong> Could he have assumed at any time you and he, you and Marshall
         Neilan -- I am speaking of Marshall Neilan now
         -- Could he have assumed at any time that he might be or was engaged to you by
         reason of your relations wtth him? </br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER:  </strong> Could Marshall Neilan have assumed that Mr
         Taylor and I were engaged?</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong> No, no; that you and Marshall Neilan were enqaged?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong> No.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong> Did you ever give him the impression that he might some day be successful in his
         effort to marry you? </br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER:  </strong> Not in my own knowledge. If I have, it was more or less of a joking way. I think
         I have at times said, "Well, Marshall, when are we going all
         around the world on our honey-moon?" exactly in the same manner as I took him to
         say, "Now, when you are my wedded bride we will do" so-andÂ­-so.
         Marshall has done that time after time. </br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong> Might he not have taken you seriously?</br><br><strong xmlns=""> MINTER:  </strong> I don't think so.</br><br><strong xmlns=""> DORAN:  </strong> Do you know he did not?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER:  </strong> No, I don't know that he did not.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong> Don't you know that he was really -- Don't you feel that he was really in love
         with you?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong> I can't truthfully answer "Yes" or "no" to that, beoause I don't know; I am not
         sure enough of Mr Neilan's nature. While I have known him a
         great many years, well, I will say I have known him several years, he is the type
         who flits back and forth, you know. - When you really think you know him he turns
         to something else, and I don't know, so I have never permitted myself to form any
         conclusions on his character; I don't know whether he has ever taken me seriously
         or not. I always treated him more or less in a joking manner.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong> I understand the night of the murrder you were with Mr
         Neilan.</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER:  </strong> No, I was not. I was at home with my grandmother and sister.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong> I mean after the murder, after you learned of the murder.</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER:  </strong> Yes, Friday.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong> The next night, was it?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong> No, it was the night after Thursday. Mr Neilan
         -- I mean Mr Taylor was found dead Thhursday
         morning, was he not?</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong> Yes.</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Thursday was such a long day. Friday night I saw
         Mr. Neilan.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN:  </strong> Did he. communicate w1 th you or you with him? </br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong> Why, he communicated with me; he tried to, but it was because of me he did that.
         On Thuraday night I was worried about Mr Taylor;
         I was worried about Mr Neilan and called Marshall's
         mother.</br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: Bella Crotta</h3><br><strong xmlns="">Doran </strong>This was after the murder?</br><br><strong xmlns="">Minter </strong>Yes, this was Thursday night after the murder. I said, "Please tell Mickey not to
         drive that green car so reckless; I am so afraid that he, too, will fall into
         trouble. And she thanked me and said, "I will tell him. That is just exactly what
         I have been thinking lately myself, and I want to see you soon, Mary." With that I
         thought no more about it. In fact, I didn't even think Marshall would
         call me. He had not called me in three weeks or more. 1 thought no more about it and
         I was surprised the next day to learn -- yes, Friday -- that he had tried to get
         me at five-thirty. My sister was at our old home where there is a telephone. The
         present home has no telephone, and when he happened to call there she was
         there.</br><br><strong xmlns="">Doran </strong>At five-thirty of what day?</br><br><strong xmlns="">Minter </strong>Friday; and he said he was very anxious to see me. She knew I had left and was
         driving with George Scarborough, and she said she didn't know what time I would be
         back. He said well, he wanted me to come to see him before ten o'clock, but after
         ten o'clock he would be on location. He didn't say the Salt Lake Station, but he
         was very anxious to get hold of me before ten o'clock. I came in after ten and
         they all told me l had better call Marshall; he seemed very anxious to get hold of
         me. I didn'tÂ· know where to call him; I thought possibly he would come to the
         house. I waited for him awhile and he didn't come, and finally grandÂ­mother said,
          "Dearie, If I were you I would call him up or at least call his mother and find
         out where he is." I called the studio and the night watchman immediately said, "Mr
         Neilan is not here; is this Miss Minter?" I said, "Yes."Friday And he said, "Mr
         Neilan is at the Salt Lake Station."Mr Scarborough and l drove down there in my
         runabout. He was very hard at work and had been all night, it seemed he had
         been working all night tor four nights past. They were all just dead tired.
         Night and day they had been working. He finished about two-thirty, and then there
         were several in the party, Gloria Swanson, Jack Pickford, Frank Urson -- Mr Frank
         Urson is now associated with Mr Neilan as director -- and Marshall and myself. We
         went to his mother's home where he lives with his mother and we tried to make eggs
         and things. It was very amusing; we only had four eggs, and I tried to fry two of
         them and ruined the things, adn we didn't have enough to go around and we made so
         much noise his mother, who was ill upstairs, told us we must behave ourselves.
         Marshall said, "There is only one thing to do; I have got to talk to you. We have
         had all of this foolishness, and I have got something very important to say to
         you, Mary. Let's drive to the studio where we can talk." We drove down to the
         Hollywood studio and we sat there in the office, the lights burning and the
         watchman was there and the property man was not around. He was outside. We talked
         until dawn; it was dawn when we came out of the place. </br><br><strong xmlns="">Doran </strong>What were you talking about?</br><br><strong xmlns="">Minter </strong>About Mr Taylor and lettersMarshall Neilan had tried to get for me.</br><br><strong xmlns="">Doran </strong>Who had tried to get for you?</br><br><strong xmlns="">Minter </strong>Marshall had tried to get for me, which was the first inkling I knew of his
         knowledge of my letters, that I had written any to Mr Taylor. He told me certain
         very, very ghastly things have since been proven absolutely true. He told
         them to me in my interest, but they made me very furious at the time, and we left
         more or less in a quarrel. </br><br><strong xmlns="">Doran </strong>Will you please tell us everything that he told you there?</br><br><strong xmlns="">Minter </strong>Yes, indeed. He first said,"Mary, sit down. I have something very importnat to
         tell you." I sat down, and he said, "You know this murder of Bill is going to be
         the greatest nine-days wonder" or "nineteen-days wonder that we have ever had,
         certainly that Los Angeles ever had. You don't know what a terrible thing it is
         going to be." I said, "Yes, I do. It is awful!" He said,  "Now, Mary, I tried to
         get your letters"-- </br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: Maria Estevez</h3><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong> We left location, he worked down at the Salt Lake Station, about two-thirty to a
         quarter to three, we left there and went to his house. How long we were there I
         couldn't say; I didn't have a watch; I imagine we were there about an hour or
         maybe more, and then we went on down to the studio and we stayed until dawn,
         whatever time that is. We then came on back to my house. Mother was waiting for us
         and we got out and explained to her. Mother knew he had had a verious talk and she
         felt sure Marhsall would try to come to our aid. My mother is very fond of Mr
         Neilan and the whole family. He said he was just dead tired. The man took his
         hours when hee needed sleep to tell me these things. He was going to be up at
          eight o'clock  that morning and he didn't even go to bed that night. He just sat up
         in his clothes and went out to work again at  eight o'clock . Anyway, he said, "I
         tried to get your letters for you. You know they are a very important factor in
         the case, if they get hold of them." I was shocked to find that he knew of my
         letters. I said that I wrote some, and he said something about going to a
         newspaper or getting hold of some body in Pasadena to get me the letters. That
         part is not clear in my mind. I think I was so tired at the time I couldn't
         understand him. I haven't seen him since or I would have questioned him again
         about the letters just what he did. He told me I should have received them that
         day. He asked me if I had gotten them and I said, "No, I haven't received the
         letters today." He said, "Well, I sent them to the studio, and I believe the
          studio," the Realart Studio where I had last worked. He said, "They are in Charley
         Eyton's hands now." He either said Charley Eyton or Mr Carbut, but I can't state
         this acutally because I was so tired at the time I could hardly hear him and I was
         desperately interested to hear what he said about the letter, and I strained all
         my nerves to hear, but instead it came back and forth; it was hazy. I don't know
         the exact words he spoke. Anyway, I remember saying, "Well, there is nothing in
         the letters that the world can't read except that it is horribly painful to me to
         have them read my letters to him." He said, "You loved Billie, didn't you?" I
         said, "Yes, Marshall, I loved him deeply and sincerely." And he said, "Did you
         ever want to marry him?" Whereupon I replied, I said, "No, no; I know it couldn't
         have been. It was not meant to be." Then we talked about -- Oh, yes. Then he said,
         "Now, Mary, I am going to tell you some very important thing; they are going to
         hurt you, going to shock you, but before I say a word I want you to consider
          Billie was just as crazy as a March hare months before his death." He said, "I am
         going to recite a few instances that Bill told me about, things irrelevant to you,
         to show he didn't do this only to you but to others of his very best friends." Marshall and Mr Taylor were extremely good friends. I don't think they saw each
         other often, but they were most affectionately fond of each other. He said, "On
         several occasions Bill" -- he spoke of him as 'Bill' -- "has confessed to me that
         -- Oh, I am so tired I can't think how I am tryingÂ­ to say it. He came up to my
         room in the club one day and he said, "Oh, I know something about you, Marshall,
         and those gold-tipped cigarettes I found of yours." Whereupon Marshall said he
         replied, "Well, you needn't say anything, Bill" -- l don't know what it was, a
         cigar or something of some personal nature that he recognized of Mr Taylor's at
         somebody's house. I don't know whose house. He said, "That makes us Elks. Don't
         you say anything about me, what I have been doing in a joking, friendly manner."
         Mr Taylor, he said, suddenly stood up and looked at him very seriously, soberly,
         and said, "Marshall, I am surprised at the things you are doing now-a-days."
         Marshall said, "Just what do you mean by that?" and he said, "Why, what you said
         to your wife the other night at Sunset Inn about poor little Gloria Swanson."</br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: Anna Fazio</h3><br><strong xmlns=""> Minter  </strong>I may be getting some of those words mixed; maybe he didn't say "poor little
         Gloria Swanson." Maybe Marshall didn't tell me that. This is my impression.
         Marshall said, "What do you mean?" And he said, "Don't you remember the night we
         were at Sunset Inn and you were sitting here and Miss Swanson was sitting there
         and your former wife, Gertrude Banbrick, came in and said, 'Hello, Gloria, how are
         you?' and Gloria replied pleasantly, and you turned to Gertrude Bambrick and said,
         'How dare you speak to this girl?' pointing to Gloria, the lady he was with, 'How
         dare you speak to her? Don't you ever dare to speak to her again,'" And Mr Taylor
         was telling Marshall Neilan. Marshall said he looked at him and said, "What's the
         matter with you, Bill? Are you drunk?" He said, I haven't had a drink," Mr Taylor
         said, and he said, "The funny part of it was he wasn't drunk." He couldn't detect
         it on his breath. "But he looked quite as serious and sober as I do this minute."
         He said, "Why, tell me what day you think this was." He said it was on a certain
         day -- I don't know if Marshall told me the day or not. He said, on a certain day
         at Sunset Inn recently. Marshall said, "Why, Bill, at that time l I was in New
         York City and was not in Los Angeles nor California." Mr Taylor and he had quite a
         friendly argument over it, and he said, "I know it is so; I was there myself and
         heard what you said upon this greeting between those two girls." Marshall said he
         thought perhaps he had lost his mind. The next day he called up, haVing that in
         mind, Miss Swanson and he said, "Gloria, am I going crazy? Have I lost my mind? Do
         you remember of ever being at Sunset Inn with me when Gertrude Bambrick passed our
         table and spoke to us pleasantly and railed at my former wife for having spoken to
         you pleasantly and told her not to speak to you again?" And she said, "What on
         earth are you talking about? What is this? I don't understand you," And he said,
         "Do you ever remember seeing Bill Taylor there near us at any time on any such
         occasion?" And she said, "Certainly not, !the oniy time I ever saw William Taylor
         at Sunset Inn was the night I was with" -- I don't know his name, some friend of
         hers -- "and Bill Taylor was sitting away over on the other side by the wall and
         we were by the orchestra on this side." He said, "Was I there?" And she said, "No.
         Don't you remember you were in New York at the time?" He said, "That is one
         instance, Mary, of Bill's failing mind, I have never cleared that up. Bill and I
         have discussed it many times since, and I have always gone away puzzled, amazed,
         that he still stuck to his version of my having spoken to my former wife as I did.
         I didn't see her; neither Miss Swanson saw her on that occasion." Then he said,
         "On another occasion Bill told me he had received a letter from Blanche Sweet;
         that she told Mr Taylor that she was grieved he was sick;" that Marshell Neilan
         was calling on me and she intended to sue him. Marshall said that sounded so
         unlike Miss Sweet that he went to her and questioned her, and he said, "Blanche,
         have you writtn to Bill lately?" She said, "Why, yes, I wrote him a little note
         not so long ago thanking him for some poinsettias he sent me Christmas." He aa1d,
         "Did you say anything else?" She said, "No, not that I can remember." He said,
         "Did you ever say that you regretted my going about with Miss Minter and that you
         intended to sue me?" She said, "Perfectly ridiculous. What do you mean? I
         certainly did not say any such thing."
         </br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: John Gehrig</h3><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>MINTER: Marshall at that time said to me, "And you know Blanche doesn't lie. She
         certainly doesn't lie; tbat is her reputation all over the world, over the picture
         game. I have heard that hundreds of times myself; I am pretty sure it is so." He
         said, "Now, that is another instance of poor Bill's insanity. Now, Mary, here is
         the ghastly thing I have to tell you." He said, "One time" -- I don't know whether
         he said in his room or the club, he was somewhere, I think in one of his own
         rooms, he, Marshall Nieilan, and Arthur Hoyt, Cap Robinson -- He said "Cap
         Robinson"; maybe he meant "Captain"; I don't know; I don't know how he is; I know
         Arthur well. He said, "We were all standing around there talking pleasantly" -- I
         think he said Antonio Moreno was there. He said, "We were all talking pleasantly
         and Mr Taylor suddenly started talking about you, and the talk grew finally more
         and more personal and finally he said -- and this is terrible -- 'presently he
         said you had been over in the last two weeks" -- I should say this is within at
         least three weeks of Mr Taylor's death; I think Marshall told me at the time, but
         I have forgotten the time. -- "within the last two weeks, that you were undressed
         in his apartments; that you beseeched him for his love; that he resisted you, and
         finally persuaded you to leave his apartments." Marshall said that to me, and looked right at me. I could feel myself grow red.
         I said, "Is that all you have to tell me about Mr Taylor?" He said, "Well, I could
         recite some more instances about Bill's seeming insanity." He said, "I am certain
         he was insane. He stood up and told those things as soberly as I am talking to you
         now." </br><br><strong xmlns="">MR MOTT: </strong>Excuse me. Did he refer to Mr Taylor's physical condition?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Yes, he said he was drunk at the time. Marshall has told ma on several occasions,
         sometimes long ago and sometimes recently that he always hated to see Bill drink
         because he said, "You wouldn't know the man; he changes so; he gets maudlin and
         silly, smiles in a foolish manner and wobbles and talks, oh, just the silly,
         foolish things." He said, "None of his friends like to see him drink." At this
         time he was intoxicated and he talked on and on and on about this thing." Marshall
         said he got up and he told Bill, "You are insane; something 1s the matter with
         your mind. I would certainly take more vengeance on you if I didn't think you were
         crazy," and that was tbe opinion of Arthur Hoyt and Cap Robinson and everybody.
         They were perfectly amazed that a man of Mr Taylor's lovable, sweet, considerate,
         gentlemanly disposition all through life should suddenly turn around and say this
         about not only a woman, but about me, whom they all knew he admired and respected.
         When I heard of this thing, l just looked to Marshall and said, "Is that all you
         have to tell me about Mr Taylor?" And he said, "Yes, that is all. That 1s the
         ghastly thing. I know you are going to hear this from somebody and I wanted you to
         hear it from me, and want to find out what you knew about the murder of this man."
          By this time I was getting -- Oh, how can I can I express it? -- just exhausted
         with shock, one shock after another and of all the shocks I had received, this
         coming from hlm who I had no reason to doubt his word, I couldn't believe it; not
         as I knew Mr Taylor, I couldn't believe for an instant he had ever said these
         things to anybody, yet there Marshall giving me names, dates and places. The thing
         was too much for me. I got furious; and I said, "I don't believe you! I think you
         are lying! How dare you say this about him to me! I never want to see you again?"
         He got up and walked around the room for a minute and I was just broiling; I was
         just furious; and he turned around and he said, "Well, Mary, some day you will
         realize that I certainly am not saying this for any personal reason. It hurts me
         as it must hurt you. I am simply telling you because you are bound to know it; it
         is the truth and I wanted to be the one to tell you. </br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: Tess Greenspan</h3><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Well, I didn't have any more to say to him. I was just furious; I was furious
         with him; and finally he talked and he said, more, more, more personal things
         about, "You know Mary that I care for you." </br><br><strong xmlns=""> DORAN:  </strong> He told you he loved you, did he? </br><br><strong xmlns=""> MINTER:  </strong> Yes; he did on  Friday night.  He said,  "You know I care for you deeply."  I said,
         "I don't care; I don't want you to care for me; I don't want John Jones to care
         for me or anybody; I don't want ever to be in love again as long as I live; I
         don't want to see any man; I hate men."   I probably raved on. I dont know what more
         I can tell you. I was so tired, exhausted; I had been sitting up all night. This
         conversation didn't come as quickly as I am te11ing it to you. It came with long
         pauses; he would get up and walk around with his cigarette smoking and come back
         again and go out and talk to the property man, go out of the office, and I would
         sit there alone and I tore a piece of paper, I was so tired, and suggested that we
         go home. I said,  "Why keep sitting up? You have got to get up at  eight o'clock in
         the morning   and it is nearly dawn."  He aaid,  "I am worried about this thing; I
         want to find out what you know about this murder."  Then it developed that Marshall
         thought I knew something about it, and he looked at me and he said,  "Now, Mary" --
         he got a little profane, he said,  "Now, Mary, for God's sake, if you know anything
         about the murder of  Bill  tell it to me now."  He said,  "Don't withhold anything."  
         This was too much; not only had he been telling me these things about  Mr Taylor,
         but there he sat evidently believing that I knew someth1ng. I said, "Do you think
         that I killed Mr Taylor?  " He said,  "Oh, no; don't be silly. Now is no time to talk
         things like that. " He said,  "I am just trying to find something out about this.
         This is going to be an awful affair."  I said,  "I didn't kill  William Desmond
         Taylor  and I don't know who murdered him." He said,  "You don't? You don't know
         anything?"   He said,  "Of course, you didn't kill him; of course, you didn't put
         anybody on to do it, But"  he said,  "don't you know somebody, don't you know some
         intiÂ­mate details that other people might not know? Can't you rack your brain and
         think who would have a motive for killing him?"  Then he sat there and we said
         words about pro and con, trying to think, and I thought over everyrody I knew and
         I said this, more or less in a humourous way, I said,  "The only person I know who
         could have had a possible motive for killing him would be  Mrs. Julia Crawford 
         Ivers." I was not serious when I said that. I was more or less humorous. She is a
         lady I feel I ought to explain about, who has never done me a wrong thing in her
         life and I have never done her a wrong thing, either, but she is a Christian
         Science lady who has been associated with him as a scenario writer for many years;
         she is quite a trusted, lovely woman, I am sure; a very honorable respectable
         woman, but we don't like eaeh other. There is no reason, but we don't like each
         other. Every time I wanted to see him, somehow she would be there and she had a
         strange way of treating me. She would say, Oh yes, there is little Mary. Here she
         comes." She would go on in this manner,  "Oh, there is little Mary again, Oh, there
         she is; wbat can she be want1ng this time? Oh, yes, uh huh."  Quite a strange
         attitude, She just riled me. </br><br><strong xmlns=""> DORAN:  </strong> How old a woman was she? </br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: Devin Halliburton</h3><br>Questions by Mr. Doran:</br><br>MINTER: She must have been 50. Her son was Mr Taylor's
         camera man. Jimmy was my camera man,
         Jim Vantrees. I don't hate the woman, but she annoys me.
         She is one of the few people in the world I dislike to see. In fact, the irony of
         fate it was when I was in France after looking at the
         beautifUl Venus de Muile in Paris at the Louvre, and after
         I had walked a few steps done a long hall, thinking of this excellent statue, who
         should I see but Julia Crawford Ivers, a very, fat, large
         woman. She did some more of these Christian Science things, and she had a very
         unpleasant habit of whenever she would be with me and Mr
         Taylor, she would always come and twit my chin. So I said, in really
         a joking manner -- I don't want to accuse the woman, because I don't think she had
         anything to do with the matter -- I said "I don't know anyone who would
         kill him but Ju1ia Crawford Ivers.""I always suspected the woman of being in love with him herself or she
         might have killed him for that reason." He said, "My goodness!
         You mustn't say that out loud; somebody will believe you." I said,
         "I don't care if they do." I was in such a wild mood, Then, --
         What else did we talk about? Oh! He talked about his
         productions and said, "I certainly have a
         terrible time, working day and night and a great deal
         depended upon Saturday and we must get certain work finished Friday." We
         talked of Fridaynight and that he had to get up at eight o'clock; he
         wasn't going to bed at all; that the boys were calling
         for him at eight o'clock, he said, and he knew if they didn't call he
         would never get up out of his slumbers. They were going somewhere on
         location, I understood, possibly at the
         studio. He was just going home
         and take a shower, get a shave if he felt like it, and go
         on back and work some more. He said, "I am dog tired. I was never so
         exhausted, just dead." Finally I said, "Do you rea1ize this
         looks awful, being here all this time?" And he said, "I can't
         help it if it does. I had to tell you these things and wanted to find out what
         you knew about this case. That I know you knew Bill very
         well, probably better than any of us and" -- Oh, yes. He also asked me
         to tel1 him my feelings toward Mr Taylor, exactly what
         everybody has been asking me, and I told him as I have been telling you, I loved
         him deeply, sincerely and absolutely; that I loved him truly, loved him in an
         all-around way, I cared for his health; his health came before my happiness and
         when he was ill -- and he didn't like to see anyone when he was ill-- my natural
         impulse was to go to him and be with him and sit up night after night with him, if
         necessary. l didn't do it; I didn t even attempt to, because he didn't want me to,
         and although I had sat in the dark, not knowing anything and worrying about it, I
         did that rather than intrude myself upon him when he didn't want me.</br><br>DORAN: What time of night did you first meet -- What is this man's
         name?</br><br>MINTER: Mr Neilan?</br><br>DORAN: Mr Neilan, this particular night.</br><br>MINTER: We went down to the Salt Lake station after

         home or whose home was it where
         you were frying the eggs?</br><br>MINTER: His home, Fridaynight; it was really Saturdaymorning, wasn't it? I call lt Fridaynight, because it was still nighttime. The five of us
         arrived there, oh, I don't know, he didn't finish work until between
         two-thirty and three o'c1ock, maybe after three; I
         didn't have a watch at that time.</br><br>DORAN: How long approximatey do you suppose you spent talking in the

         more than an hour. Then we went right on to the

         "Let's get out of here. I am burning up alive." It was very cold
         when we came in the house and we put on steam and then he got terribly hot. I
         don't know what was the matter with me, I wouldn't take off my coat. He said,
         "If you are going to stay there and burn, let's go out and
         talk." We got in the car and drove around for a while. No, it is not a
         fact that he said in the house, "We must go to the studio and
         talk." I think I said that at first; it is not so. He said,
         "Let's go out and talk." Then it was very bitterly cold outside,
         freez1ng ocld.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>You left the rest of the party at the house?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>No; Miss Swanson and Mr Pickford got in
         Mr Pickford's Locomobile and he said he was going to take her home. She was very
         anxious to get to bed as she had to get up early and work.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Then, you and Marshall Neilan drove around awhile and
         finally wound up in the studio?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Yes; we drove around, went out Sunset Boulevard and went up -- We went along
         Hollywood Boulevard for a while, </br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>What did you discuss while you were riding around in the machine?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Why, about this thing about Mr Taylor and then also I was rather peeved at
         Marshall at the time because I hadn't heard from him in weeks. "Peeved" is hardly
         the word. That sounds more as if I am interested in Marshall, and I am; I like
         him, but l wasn't caring particularly; I simply said, "Well, Marshall, it was not
         a very nice thing the way you ran off the last time. I understood they were going
         out to dinner and you were coming to my house to dinner and suddenly you went to
         San Francisco without so much as a fare-thee-well."' He said, "You know I do those
         things." I said, "Yes, you do those things, and it ts very annoying, but your
         friends love you and love you yet in spite of those funny little tricks you do,
         darting here and there. I don't know, I am in no mood to take this foolishness; I
         want good wholesome friendship, but I want to know when you are going to appear."
         Many times a whole dinner has gotten cold waiting for him. When we had a dinner
         party at our house, or other people have given parties, they have waited on
         Marshall for two or three hours and he finally would come along smiling sweetly at
         everybody and they couldn't scold him. I was more or less taking him to task for
         his 1ife in general, saying he should not do those things; it was very annoying
         and I was not going to put up with it. He was sweet and Irish and said, "You
         wouldn't be angry with me?" And I said, "No, I wouldn't be." That is the way we
         got out of that. There was nothing serious in the talk, Just the way we always
         talked. </br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Then you finally went to the studio?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Finally he said, "Now, I have got something very important to tell you, something
         that is going to hurt your feelings terribly, but I must tell you; we wi11 go in
         the studio and talk." Our teeth were chatter1ng with cold and we went in there and
         he turned on the steam and I sat in this fur coat in a wicker chair, and he said,
         "This is going to b, a nine or "nineteen-days talk of the world" Then he told me
         all the things I have been telling you. There may have been some more, and some
         thlngs I have said may not be exactly accurate, but the gist of the thing is
         entirely accurate. </br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: Eric Holsinger</h3><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Did he declare his love for you, whi1e rid1ng around in the machine?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>No, he did not.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Not until you reached the studio did he do tha that?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Not until after we had been there a long time at the studio.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Was it before or after he told you about this instance in connection with
         Taylor --</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>It was afterwards. I don't know yet whether he really meant it; maybe he was as
         sincere as he could be, and he can be very sincere, I am sure. I am sure he can.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>This was the second time that he had declared love for you. On one occasion he
         proposed to you?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Yes.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>He asked you to marry him?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Yes, and then he would dart away again. I mean he would call me up -- He can't call
         me up, because I have no telephone; he would send me flowers, too, and suddenly I
         would not hear from him for two or three weeks. As I said to him in the car, not
         particularly about that but about other things, about dinner engagements, about &amp;
         appointments, I said, "You know, Marshall, I never know when l
         am going to see you and when I am not going to see you, and just what you are going
         to do, and I am in no mood to go on like that at all; I don't care much about
         it."</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>When did you tell him that?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>I told him that when we were driving the car.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>How old a man is Marshall Neilan?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Just thirty.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Has he ever been married?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Yes, he has been married once for a few days. He remained married to his wife for a
         long time, for seven years, I think, but he was actually only married a few days. I
         think he married when he was twenty or nineteen.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Have you seen him since this Friday night?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>No, I have not.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Have you talked with him over the telephone?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>It was really Saturday morning.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Has he called you up on the telephone?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>No; he may have called me at the New Hampshire house and I wouldn't know.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>You haven't talked with him over the telephone?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>I haven't seen him or talked to him or come in touch with him in any way</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>You haven't received any letters from him?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>No.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Did you part friendly or unfriendly?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>We did part more or less friendly, as I always did with
         Marshall, no matter how angry I would become with him,
         somehow you can't bear malice against that boy.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>You have become angry with him on other occasions?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Yes. This night for the time being, I was furious [missing page] [...] Mr
         Neilan -- Taylor's, and at the time of
         Mr Taylor's death, Harry was the
         assistant director in Mr Taylor's companies there, and he had
         said Harry had been in the room looking over the effects -- Just
         a minute. I wonder if Charles Maigne told me this. I think
         Mr Neilan told me this, too, that Harry
         bad gotten the letters and taken them to Jim Vantrees, the
         camera man, whereupon I remarked, "I will bet Mrs Ivers
         had them," and I think he said, "Jim gave them
         to Mr Eyton," and that Mr Eyton
         turned some of them over to the Examiner. I am so afraid l am telling things that
         are
         not so here, Mr Doran; I don't mean to, but I couldn't get all
         of it. That is as clear as I can make it. Anyway, I do remember this part, he said
         he
         heard about them, and I don't know how he heard about them, and that he went down,
         I
         believe, to the Examiner, to get ahold of them and he had something to do with
         Pasadena, a man, he did tell me the man's name. I don't remember his name, but I
         believe it beÂ­gan with "S", and this man, Marshall said he was
         the big man over the entire Examiner force, told him to go down and take the letters.
         He said, "Of course, if you breathe this it wi11 just about throw me in jail
         for the rest of my life," but I don't believe it will. Then he said,
         "Didn't you get them today?" I said, "I did not." As
         well as I remember, Marshall said, "I then sent them to
         the Realart Studio and they ought to be in Charley's hands
         now or Mr Garbut." This whole Friday night is most hasy in my
         recollection.</br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: Evan Klimas</h3><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>This man knew before you were in love with Mr Taylor?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Oh, yes.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>You had told him that, had you not?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>No; in fact, I had never said to Marshall"I am in love with William Desmond
         Taylor." I never had.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>How did he find it out, then?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>He knew about it, because we had been friends a long time. Before
         this Marshall had come to my
         house very despondent and said, "I think I will
         go out in the garden and eat wooly
         worms."
         I said, "Don't feel that way; there are plenty of us who feel the same
         way." I am certain he knew about this thing. I made no secret of it,
         but I didn't promenade it about.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Don't you have a recollection of having told him, Marshall Neilan, that you were fond of Taylor?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>No. Many times I said, "I admire Mr Taylor; I respect him; you know I respect his opinion; what a
         wonderful man I consider him to be." He knew I regarded him most
         highly.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Do you remember if he asked you at the time he proÂ­posed to you
         if you were in love with any one else?</br><br><strong xmlns="">INTER: </strong>No, he didn't ask me that at all.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Did you have any admirers who might have been jealous of
         him?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>There was only one possible admirer, and that was Mr Dickson.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Any besides Mr
         Dickson?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>No; in fact, if I may say so, neither Mr
         Dickson nor Mr Neilan has been
         with me constantly enough, or I feel really care enough for me to do any such
         thing in my behalf, I mean such as commit murder. In my own mind I am absolutely
         convinced that I know they would not.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Yon think they are incapable, in other words?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>I absolutely do.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>What kind of cigarettes was Neilan smoking the night at the studio?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>He smokes two kinds of cigarettes. He smokes a gold tipped called "Dimi" something from
         Egypt, I forget the name, "D" something; I noticed it
         comes from Cairo; then he smokes Chesterfield
         cigarettes. At least, I have seen him smoking
         Chesterfield cigarettes. I remember that much, because I
         have always admired the face of the Chesterfield boy on that red back
         sign, you know, that laughing boy in the light hair that says,
         "Gee"! They satisfy!"</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Did Neilan take you
         home then that morning from the
         studio or did you go back in your own car?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>No; my car had been driven back to its
         garage by Mr Neilan's
         chauffeur with my friend Mr
         Scarborough in it. Poor Mr
         Scarborough had been driving around with me all evening. I hadn't
         been able to sleep and that was why I ws_ out. He said if I didn't mind he would
         just go on back home, now that I was in safe hands, and get
         some sleep. He was pretty near dead tired. He isn't a very strong man.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>So Neilan took you
         home then</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Yes; right straight home.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Did he ask you to keep in confidence the conversation you had
         had with him? Did he tell you not to say anything about it?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>l don't remember him saying to me, "You must keep this all
         in secret oonfidenoe"; no, I do not, because when we got
         home we discussed some of the things with mother, with
         the whole family, in fact; he discussed the seriousness of the conversation and
         told me not to do anything without my atÂ­torneys.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>He told you that?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>Yes; he said, "You mustn't make any move without your
         attorneys." He spoke of Mr Mott and
         said Mr Mott was very able and that he would tell
         me the right thing to do and not to make a move without him.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Did you comment on his concern?</br><br><strong xmlns="">MINTER: </strong>No.</br><br><strong xmlns="">DORAN: </strong>Did you say anything to him, for instance to this effect:
         "Why should you be so concerned about me? Why should I consult
         attorneys in connection with this affair?" or
         anything like that?</br><hr xmlns=""></hr>
      <h3 xmlns="">Edited by: Audrey Lee</h3><br><strong xmlns=""> MINTER:  </strong> No, I did not, because at the time, when I asked him if he suspected me of
         killing Mr Taylor, we had that out; he assured me he didn't suspect any such
         thing, but he was very much impressed with the gravity of the situation. In fact,
         evidently he knew at that time exactly how these things were going to turn out. I
         mean that they would drag everybody's name into it; that the papers could get hold
         of for the notoriety of it. He said, "This involves picture people and you know
         how Hearst hates the picture people. Hearst would do anything &amp; could if he
         thought you did know Mr Taylor," "There are lots of prominent people in the
         profession who knew him and loved him. They are certainly going to drag your name
         into it." </br><br><strong xmlns=""> DORAN:  </strong> You didn't telephone Taylor on the night he was murdered? </br><br><strong xmlns=""> MINTER:  </strong> No. </br><br><strong xmlns=""> DORAN:  </strong> Where did you happen to be that night? </br><br><strong xmlns=""> MINTER:  </strong> I was at home reading the Cruise of the Kewa. It is a humorous book; it is
         really a travesty of Frederick O'Brien's stories of the South Seas. It is very
         funny, and I laid there laughing all the evening. I was very -- right while I was
         laying on the couch reading aloud to mother and sister and we were all laughing
         heartily at that time, and at the same time Mr Taylor was being murdered. It seems
         very horrible to me. </br><br><strong xmlns=""> DORAN:  </strong>You had no company at home that night? </br><br><strong xmlns=""> MINTER:  </strong> Let me see. I don't remember any. Possibly Mr Stockdale, he generally did, or
         maybe somebody dropped in. I don't just remember. Usually every evening somebody
         drops [page 40] in. I know they were not there at the time I was reading the book.
         </br><br><strong xmlns=""> DORAN:  </strong> Your automobiles were all home? </br><br><strong xmlns=""> MINTER:  </strong> Yes, unless I put my car in the garage called the Standard Garage. I leave it
         there sometimes, the Standard Garage on Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue.
         Sometimes when my girl friends stop with me and have her car, I would move out and
         put it in this garage and maybe wouldn't call for it for several days. I haven't
         been feeling well for some time; I have had bronchitis. I hadn't gotten well when
         this awful shock came to me, and I haven't used the little car very much.</br><br><strong xmlns=""> DORAN:  </strong> Do you have a chauffeur? </br><br><strong xmlns=""> MINTER:  </strong> Yes; faithful old Chauncy. Chauncy is just as concerned about this thing as my
         mother is.</br><br><strong xmlns=""> DORAN:  </strong> Well, I don't think of anything else I care to inquire about now. </br><br><strong xmlns=""> MINTER:  </strong> Mr Doran, if I can be of any possible help in any way, it is true I don't know
         any more than I have told you; if I can, please call on me the first thing, won't
         you? </br><br><strong xmlns=""> DORAN:  </strong> Thank you, very much. You may think of little things of which you may not
         appreciate the imporance, Mr Mott. </br><br><strong xmlns=""> MINTER:  </strong> As I told Mr Mott today, I remember saying to Mr Mott, "I am so tired I am like
         a little child. I speak words mechanically. I sit, sleep, get up, walk and dress,
         and I don't see exactly what I am doing." </br><hr />
