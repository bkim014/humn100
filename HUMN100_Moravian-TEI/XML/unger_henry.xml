               <p> their Heart Departed this Life. I. I. Henr. Unger as Ober Peyle the 3 of this Month. He was born the 25th of Jan. 1721 at Berthelsdorf Our Saviour made a Pretension on his Heart
                  from his youth and he was embarrassed how to become happy but did not know how to find Rest for his poor Soul, till at last he hear by the Brethren in Peterswalde of our Saviours
                  Love to poor Sinners became thereby convinced &amp; deplored grace through his Wounds. He was as well in relation to his Body as his Mind a object of commiseration. By all that our
                  saviour bestowed Mercy on him and he was Ao 1746 the 29th of Jan. in our congregation received. Few years after he became indifferent and by &amp; by hardhearted, so that the
                  Brethren were forced to excommunicate him from their Society &amp; let him go on in his own Ways. Ao 1750 he marryed Ana Rosine Shabel &amp; with three children, one of them is gone
                  home &amp; two are in the care of the congregation. After that he returned again very perplexed about his Misdeed </p>

               <p> misdeed and begged forgiveness with many fears, and desireth the Congregation would intercide by our Saviours, to bestow mercy on him, as a poor creature who brought all they
                  miserys and unhappiness on himself. Our Saviour mercy as he is granted his desire and gave leave to absolve him from all his sins! 1752 the 9th of April he got the grace to partake
                  on our Lords Supper, whereby his heart melted with 1000 tears. The 20th October he got leave to move to Ober Peile and soon to Gnadenfrey. But in the time following he came here in
                  such a Confusion of hind and a distraction of his senses that he removed to Ober Peyle again. But our Saviour whose eye was fixed on him didnt forsake him, but showed mercy on him
                  again, he bowed down as a sinner for his feet and in so he was readmitted again to the graces of the Congregation. Since two year he became quite Contract [sic], so that he neither
                  go or stirr, every Brother who came to see him was a real comfort to him, however our Saviour and his Congregation shortened and diminished his bodly Pain and smart. Several days
                  passed his end seemed to be pretty near, so that he was not more able to speak, but he recovered himself and said: poor as I am! One view in his wounds can bring me again, but as a
                  sinner /// I'll go home. Today a Brethern came to so see him and he was just on the Brink of to go home, he sung some verses under which he went to our Saviour in the 43. Year of his
                  Age. II The marryed Sister Rosine Taneberger. She was Ao. 1708 born at Mankendorf in Moravia. Her Vaters name was Geo. Weber. The holy ghost had from her tender youth his work in her
                  Heart and she spent her time continually without rest in her soul. In her 25th year of Age she marryed Michel Taneberger. She 2 boys with him but they died very young. She very often
                  pineth to hear the gospel of Jesus sufferings of Death, therefore she often begged dear God to slice her Desire and help her to a Place where she could find rest for her poor soul,
                  then she could not find that in her Mother Country. Ao. 1753 the 13th October she got a feeling in her Heart to move to Gnaden frey, they happened as much as possible and leaped
                  hardly from their Pursers. The 31 of Dec. the arrived here very much rejoyced. Soon after a critical occasion pretty nearly persuadeth her Husband to remove from here to his son. She
                  therefore was so embarassed and intreated our Saviour in her perplexity saying: Scarce my Heart catched a part of grace, and instead to become a fire he will be quenched. </p>
