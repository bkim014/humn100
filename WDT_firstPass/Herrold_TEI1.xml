               <ab>Do you suppose you spent <time>a couple of hours</time> down there?</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab> I think maybe we spent <time>a couple of hours</time>; maybe <time>three hours</time>; it takes a good
                  while to go from <placeName>Salt Lake station</placeName> up to
                     <placeName>Marshall's home on Sunset Boulevard</placeName>. It would take <time>at
                  least forty-five minutes</time>, I think. Then it takes some time to go from
                     <placeName>his home</placeName> to <placeName>the studio</placeName>, way out
                     <placeName>on Santa Monica Boulevard</placeName>.</ab>

            <sp>

               <ab> Where was <placeName>the studio</placeName>?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab> On <placeName>Santa Monica Boulevard, the Hollyood Studios</placeName>.</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN:</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab>He said, <quote>"Let's go on down"</quote> -- No, the first thing he said was
                     <quote>"Let's get out of here. I am burning up alive."</quote> It was very cold
                  when we came in the house and we put on steam and then he got terribly hot. I
                  don't know what was the matter with me, I wouldn't take off <objectName>my coat</objectName>. He said,
                     <quote>"If you are going to stay there and burn, let's go out and
                     talk."</quote> We got in <objectName>the car</objectName> and drove around for a while. No, it is not a
                  fact that he said in <placeName>the house</placeName>, <quote>"We must go to <placeName>the studio</placeName> and
                     talk."</quote> I think I said that at first; it is not so. He said,
                     <quote>"Let's go out and talk."</quote> Then it was very bitterly cold outside,

               <ab>No; <persName ref="#swanson_gloria">Miss Swanson</persName> and <persName ref="#pickford_jack">Mr Pickford</persName> got in
                  Mr Pickford's <objectName>Locomobile</objectName> and he said he was going to take her home. She was very
                  anxious to get to bed as she had to get up early and work.</ab>

               <ab>Then, you and <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall Neilan</persName> drove around awhile and
                  finally wound up in <placeName>the studio</placeName>?</ab>

               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab>Yes; we drove around, went out <placeName>Sunset Boulevard</placeName> and went up -- We went along
                  <placeName>Hollywood Boulevard</placeName> for a while, </ab>

               <ab>What did you discuss while you were riding around in <objectName>the machine</objectName>?</ab>

               <ab>Why, about this thing about <persName ref="#taylor_william">Mr Taylor</persName> and then also I was rather peeved at
                  <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName> at the time because I hadn't heard from him in weeks. "Peeved" is hardly
                  the word. That sounds more as if I am interested in <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName>, and I am; I like
                  him, but l wasn't caring particularly; I simply said, <quote>"Well, <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName>, it was not
                  a very nice thing the way you ran off the last time. I understood they were going
                  out to dinner and you were coming to <placeName>my house</placeName> to dinner and suddenly you went to
                  <placeName>San Francisco</placeName> without so much as a fare-thee-well."</quote>' He said, <quote>"You know I do those
                  things."</quote> I said, <quote>"Yes, you do those things, and it ts very annoying, but your
                  friends love you and love you yet in spite of those funny little tricks you do,
                  darting here and there. I don't know, I am in no mood to take this foolishness; I
                  want good wholesome friendship, but I want to know when you are going to appear."</quote>
                  Many times a whole dinner has gotten cold waiting for him. When we had a dinner
                  party at <placeName>our house</placeName>, or other people have given parties, they have waited on
                  <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName> for <time>two or three hours</time> and he finally would come along smiling sweetly at
                  everybody and they couldn't scold him. I was more or less taking him to task for
                  his 1ife in general, saying he should not do those things; it was very annoying
                  and I was not going to put up with it. He was sweet and Irish and said, <quote>"You
                  wouldn't be angry with me?"</quote> And I said, <quote>"No, I wouldn't be."</quote> That is the way we
                  got out of that. There was nothing serious in the talk, Just the way we always
                  talked. </ab>

               <ab>Then you finally went to <placeName>the studio</placeName>?</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab>Finally he said, <quote>"Now, I have got something very important to tell you, something
                  that is going to hurt your feelings terribly, but I must tell you; we wi11 go in
                  <placeName>the studio</placeName> and talk."</quote> Our teeth were chatter1ng with cold and we went in there and
                  he turned on the steam and I sat in this <objectName>fur coat</objectName> in a <objectName>wicker chair</objectName>, and he said,
                  <quote>"This is going to b, a nine or "nineteen-days talk of the world"</quote> Then he told me
                  all the things I have been telling you. There may have been some more, and some
                  thlngs I have said may not be exactly accurate, but the gist of the thing is
                  entirely accurate. </ab>
