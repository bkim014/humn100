               <ab>No, absolutely none; it looked like he just walked in the door and was shot in the back; that is the way it looked. It didn't show evidence in the room when I got there- neither the room or the body showed any evidence of a struggle. He had on the same <objectName>suit<objectName> as when I seen him the day before when he talked to me.</ab>
