                     >Mr Taylor</persName> in five months at the time -- three months, I know; three
                  months, and I just got to thinking about it and I decided I couldn't stand it any
                  longer. I was going to go up and tell him "goodbye. I got up and dressed, went
                  down to my grandmother's room and I said, "Mama, I am going over to say 'goodbye'
                  to Mr Taylor," and she advised me not to do it. She said it was too late: "Do you
                  know it is nearly twelve o'clock?" she said. I said, "Yes, sure, but I just must
                  do so," I said, "I realize that this is not the usual thing and I have never been
                  there so late, but I must do so, Mama. I am going to give him a letter in whioh I
                  have told him 'goodbye,"' She said, "All right, then, if you must. I would get up
                  and go with you, but I don't feel well enough," Mama often accompanied me on my
                  trips, which were not very many during the entire time that i knew him. So I went
                  over there and arrived at five minutes to twelve, I am strange about that, I am
                  rather queer about that, I think of the time; every time I was with him I would
                  say, "Well, this time yesterday I didn't see him and today I am with him," and
                  things like that. So I arrived at five minutes to twelve and left at twenty
                  minutes to one, and-- Do you wish me to tell you all that transpired?</ab>
