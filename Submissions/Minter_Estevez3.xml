               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab> We left location, he worked down at the <placeName>Salt Lake Station</placeName>, about <time when-iso= "02:30">two-thirty to a
                  quarter to three</time>, we left there and went to <placeName>his house</placeName>. How long we were there I
                  couldn't say; I didn't have a <objectName>watch</objectName>; I imagine we were there about an hour or
                  maybe more, and then we went on down to the <placeName>studio</placeName> and we stayed until <time>dawn</time>,
                  whatever time that is. We then came on back to <placeName>my house</placeName>. <persName>Mother</persName> was waiting for us
                  and we got out and explained to her. <persName>Mother</persName> knew he had had a verious talk and she
                  felt sure <persName>Marhsall</persName> would try to come to our aid. My <persName>mother</persName> is very fond of <persName>Mr
                  Neilan</persName> and the whole family. He said he was just dead tired. The man took his
                  hours when hee needed sleep to tell me these things. He was going to be up at
                  <time when-iso= "08:00"> eight o'clock </time> that morning and he didn't even go to <objectName>bed</objectName> that night. He just sat up
                  in his <objectName>clothes</objectName> and went out to work again at <time when-iso= "08:00"> eight o'clock </time>. Anyway, he said, "I
                  tried to get your <objectName type= "communication">letters</objectName> for you. You know they are a very important factor in
                  the case, if they get hold of them." I was shocked to find that he knew of my
                  <objectName type= "communication">letters</objectName>. I said that I wrote some, and he said something about going to a
                  <objectName>newspaper</objectName> or getting hold of some body in <placeName>Pasadena</placeName> to get me the <objectName type= "communication">letters</objectName>. That
                  part is not clear in my mind. I think I was so tired at the time I couldn't
                  understand him. I haven't seen him since or I would have questioned him again
                  about the <objectName type= "communication">letters</objectName> just what he did. He told me I should have received them that
                  day. He asked me if I had gotten them and I said, "No, I haven't received the
                  <objectName type= "communication">letters</objectName> today." He said, "Well, I sent them to the <placeName>studio</placeName>, and I believe the
                 <placeName> studio</placeName>," the <placeName>Realart Studio</placeName> where I had last worked. He said, "They are in Charley
                  <persName>Eyton's</persName> hands now." He either said <persName>Charley Eyton</persName> or <persName>Mr Carbut</persName>, but I can't state
                  this acutally because I was so tired at the time I could hardly hear him and I was
                  desperately interested to hear what he said about the <objectName type= "communication">letter</objectName>, and I strained all
                  my nerves to hear, but instead it came back and forth; it was hazy. I don't know
                  the exact words he spoke. Anyway, I remember saying, "Well, there is nothing in
                  the <objectName type= "communication">letters</objectName> that the world can't read except that it is horribly painful to me to
                  have them read my <objectName>letters</objectName> to him." He said, "You loved <persName>Billie</persName>, didn't you?" I
                  said, "Yes, <persName>Marshall</persName>, I loved him deeply and sincerely." And he said, "Did you
                  ever want to marry him?" Whereupon I replied, I said, "No, no; I know it couldn't
                  have been. It was not meant to be." Then we talked about -- Oh, yes. Then he said,
                  "Now, <persName>Mary</persName>, I am going to tell you some very important thing; they are going to
                  hurt you, going to shock you, but before I say a word I want you to consider
                 <persName> Billie</persName> was just as crazy as a March hare months before his death." He said, "I am
                  going to recite a few instances that <persName>Bill</persName> told me about, things irrelevant to you,
                  to show he didn't do this only to you but to others of his very best friends." </ab>

               <ab>Marshall and <persName>Mr Taylor</persName> were extremely good friends. I don't think they saw each
                  other often, but they were most affectionately fond of each other. He said, "On
                  several occasions <persName>Bill</persName>" -- he spoke of him as '<persName>Bill</persName>' -- "has confessed to me that
                  -- Oh, I am so tired I can't think how I am trying­ to say it. He came up to my
                  room in the <placeName>club</placeName> one day and he said, "Oh, I know something about you, <persName>Marshall</persName>,
                  and those gold-tipped <objectName>cigarettes</objectName> I found of yours." Whereupon <persName>Marshall</persName> said he
                  replied, "Well, you needn't say anything, Bill" -- l don't know what it was, a
                  <objectName>cigar</objectName> or something of some personal nature that he recognized of <persName>Mr Taylor</persName>'s at
                  <placeName>somebody's house</placeName>. I don't know whose house. He said, "That makes us Elks. Don't
                  you say anything about me, what I have been doing in a joking, friendly manner."
                  <persName>Mr Taylor</persName>, he said, suddenly stood up and looked at him very seriously, soberly,
                  and said, "<persName>Marshall</persName>, I am surprised at the things you are doing now-a-days."
                  <persName>Marshall</persName> said, "Just what do you mean by that?" and he said, "Why, what you said
                  to your <persName>wife</persName> the other night at <time>Sunset</time> Inn about poor little <persName>Gloria Swanson</persName>."</ab>
