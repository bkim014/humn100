                  She thought it was a gunshot. She went to her front door and opened the door, and saw a man standing in Mr. Taylor's door. She looked at him, and he stood and looked at her; and he walked down 
                  the steps, turned to the left, and going around the end of the building, which is to the east; and out into the street.</ab>
