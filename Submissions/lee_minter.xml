               <ab> No, I did not, because at the time, when I asked him if he suspected me of
                  killing <persName>Mr Taylor</persName>, we had that out; he assured me he didn't suspect any such
                  thing, but he was very much impressed with the gravity of the situation. In fact,
                  evidently he knew at that time exactly how these things were going to turn out. I
                  mean that they would drag everybody's name into it; that the papers could get hold
                  of for the notoriety of it. He said, "This involves picture people and you know
                  how <persName>Hearst</persName> hates the picture people. <persName>Hearst</persName> would do anything &amp; could if he
                  thought you did know <persName>Mr Taylor</persName>," "There are lots of prominent people in the
                  profession who knew him and loved him. They are certainly going to drag your name
                  into it." </ab>

               <ab> I was at <placeName>home</placeName> reading the <objectName>Cruise of the Kewa</objectName>. It is a humorous <objectName>book</objectName>; it is
                  really a travesty of <persName>Frederick O'Brien's</persName> stories of the South Seas. It is very
                  funny, and I laid there laughing all the <time>evening</time>. I was very -- right while I was
                  laying on the <objectName>couch</objectName> reading aloud to <persName>mother</persName> and sister and we were all laughing
                  heartily at that time, and at the same time <persName>Mr Taylor</persName> was being murdered. It seems
                  very horrible to me. </ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker> MINTER: </speaker>
               <ab> Let me see. I don't remember any. Possibly <persName>Mr Stockdale</persName>, he generally did, or
                  maybe somebody dropped in. I don't just remember. Usually every evening somebody
                  drops [page 40] in. I know they were not there at the time I was reading the book.

            <sp>
               <speaker> MINTER: </speaker>
               <ab> Yes, unless I put my <objectName>car</objectName> in the garage called the <placeName>Standard Garage</placeName>. I leave it
                  there sometimes, the <placeName>Standard Garage</placeName> on <placeName>Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue</placeName>.
                  Sometimes when my girl friends stop with me and have her <objectName>car</objectName>, I would move out and
                  put it in this garage and maybe wouldn't call for it for several days. I haven't
                  been feeling well for some time; I have had bronchitis. I hadn't gotten well when
                  this awful shock came to me, and I haven't used the little car very much.</ab>

                  any more than I have told you; if I can, please call on me the first thing, won't
                  you? </ab>

                  a little child. I speak words mechanically. I sit, sleep, get up, walk and dress,
                  and I don't see exactly what I am doing." </ab>
