               <ab>I may be getting some of those words mixed; maybe he didn't say "poor little
                  <persName ref="#Swanson">Gloria Swanson</persName>." Maybe <persName ref="#Neilon">Marshall</persName> didn't tell me that. This is my impression.
                  <persName ref="#Neilan">Marshall</persName> said, "What do you mean?" And he said, "Don't you remember the night we
                  were at <placeName>Sunset Inn</placeName> and you were sitting here and <persName ref="#Swansan">Miss Swanson</persName> was sitting there
                  and your former wife, <persName ref="#Banbrick">Gertrude Banbrick</persName>, came in and said, 'Hello, <persName ref="#Swanson">Gloria</persName>, how are
                  you?' and <persName ref="#Swanson">Gloria</persName> replied pleasantly, and you turned to <persName ref="#Bambrick">Gertrude Bambrick</persName> and said,
                  'How dare you speak to this girl?' pointing to <persName ref="#Swanson">Gloria</persName>, the lady he was with, 'How
                  dare you speak to her? Don't you ever dare to speak to her again,'" And <persName ref="#Taylor">Mr Taylor</persName>
                  was telling <persName ref="#Neilan">Marshall Neilan</persName>. <persName ref="#Neilan">Marshall</persName> said he looked at him and said, "What's the
                  matter with you, <persName ref="#Taylor">Bill</persName>? Are you drunk?" He said, I haven't had a drink," <persName ref="#Taylor">Mr Taylor</persName>
                  said, and he said, "The funny part of it was he wasn't drunk." He couldn't detect
                  it on his breath. "But he looked quite as serious and sober as I do this minute."
                  He said, "Why, tell me what day you think this was." He said it was on a certain
                  day -- I don't know if <persName ref="#Neilan">Marshall</persName> told me the day or not. He said, on a certain day
                  at <placeName>Sunset Inn</placeName> recently. <persName ref="#Neilan">Marshall</persName> said, "Why, <persName ref="#Taylor">Bill</persName>, at that time l I was in <placeName>New
                  York City</placeName> and was not in <placeName>Los Angeles</placeName> nor <placeName>California</placeName>." <persName ref="#Taylor">Mr Taylor</persName> and he had quite a
                  friendly argument over it, and he said, "I know it is so; I was there myself and
                  heard what you said upon this greeting between those two girls." <persName ref="#Neilan">Marshall</persName> said he
                  thought perhaps he had lost his mind. The next day he called up, haVing that in
                  mind, <persName ref="#Swanson">Miss Swanson</persName> and he said, "<persName ref="#Swanson">Gloria</persName>, am I going crazy? Have I lost my mind? Do
                  you remember of ever being at Sunset Inn with me when Gertrude Bambrick passed our
                  table and spoke to us pleasantly and railed at my former wife for having spoken to
                  you pleasantly and told her not to speak to you again?" And she said, "What on
                  earth are you talking about? What is this? I don't understand you," And he said,
                  "Do you ever remember seeing <persName ref="#Taylor">Bill Taylor</persName> there near us at any time on any such
                  occasion?" And she said, "Certainly not, !the oniy time I ever saw <persName ref="#Taylor">William Taylor</persName>
                  at <placeName>Sunset Inn</placeName> was the night I was with" -- I don't know his name, some friend of
                  hers -- "and <persName ref="#Taylor">Bill Taylor</persName> was sitting away over on the other side by the wall and
                  we were by the orchestra on this side." He said, "Was I there?" And she said, "No.
                  Don't you remember you were in <placeName>New York</placeName> at the time?" He said, "That is one
                  instance, <persName ref="#Minter">Mary</persName>, of <persName ref="#Taylor">Bill's</persName> failing mind, I have never cleared that up. <persName ref="#Taylor">Bill</persName> and I
                  have discussed it many times since, and I have always gone away puzzled, amazed,
                  that he still stuck to his version of my having spoken to my former wife as I did.
                  I didn't see her; neither <persName ref="#Swanson">Miss Swanson</persName> saw her on that occasion." Then he said,
                  "On another occasion <persName ref="#Taylor">Bill</persName> told me he had received a <objectName ref="#letter">letter</objectName> from <persName ref="#Sweet">Blanche Sweet</persName>;
                  that she told <persName ref="#Taylor">Mr Taylor</persName> that she was grieved he was sick;" that <persName ref="#Neilon">Marshell Neilan</persName>
                  was calling on me and she intended to sue him. <persName ref="#Neilan">Marshall</persName> said that sounded so
                  unlike <persName ref="#Sweet">Miss Sweet</persName> that he went to her and questioned her, and he said, "<persName ref="#Sweet">Blanche</persName>,
                  have you writtn to <persName ref="#Taylor">Bill</persName> lately?" She said, "Why, yes, I wrote him a little <objectName ref="#letter">note</objectName>
                  not so long ago thanking him for some poinsettias he sent me <date>Christmas</date>." He aa1d,
                  "Did you say anything else?" She said, "No, not that I can remember." He said,
                  "Did you ever say that you regretted my going about with <persName ref="#Minter">Miss Minter</persName> and that you
                  intended to sue me?" She said, "Perfectly ridiculous. What do you mean? I
                  certainly did not say any such thing."
