               Questions by Mr. Doran: -->

            <sp>
               <speaker>MR DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>At that time, on <date>December 23d</date>, let's see, he was killed on
                     <date>February 1st</date>. Who was directing you then?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>Why, no one was. I had finished a picture.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>Who directed the last one?</ab>
            </sp>



            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <!-- @Jules - the <roleName> in this case should wrap around the word "director" rather than the person's name. -->
               <ab>My last <roleName>director</roleName> was <persName>Frank Urson</persName>.
                     <persName>Mr. Taylor</persName> so often, often made the remark to me that he
                  wished tbat he were younger; he wanted to be younger. We undoubtedly would have
                  been married today and he been younger. He explained our not. being engaged in
                  that way. I knew we never could be married; I also knew I never would love for
                  another human being in the way I cared for him. So he would say, <quote>"You know,
                        <persName>Mary</persName>, to me you are the morning
                        <objectName>sun</objectName>, bright, beaut1ful, and with the
                        <objectName>world</objectName> and a futune before you, and I am the setting
                        <objectName>sun</objectName>, and don't you see, my dear, it simply cannot
                     be.</quote> I hope tbat doesn't give you the impression that I begged him to
                  marry me. I never did in my life. I couldn't do that. I never even called him
                     <persName>"Billie"</persName> in my life. The man was too wonderful for that.
                  He was wonderful. I don't care what anybody says or what they prove against him. I
                  knew him as the finest thing in the <objectName>world</objectName>.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MR MOTT</speaker>
               <ab>He as the embodyment of your ideal?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>Yes, and I can say now that I can't truthfully -- I don't know any of those ugly
                  things which have been said about him. I never found him so. He was glorious to
                  me.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MR DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>I read in the <objectName>paper</objectName> where you had been engaged to some
                  other man.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>To <persName>Mr Dickson</persName>. That is not entirely true.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>What is his first name?</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab><persName>Thomas Dickson</persName>.</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>Someone besides him, a director in the movies.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab><persName>Marshall Neilan</persName>, engaged to him?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>Yes, <persName>Marshall Neilan</persName>. Didn't I read in the
                     <objectName>papers</objectName> that you had been engaged to him and the
                  engagement had been broken off?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>That is not true. <persName>Mr Dickson</persName> is the only one to whom I have
                  been even remotely engaged, and that was a freak of despondency.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>What about <persName>Marshall Neilan</persName>? Were you engaged to him?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>No.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>Had you been going with <persName>Marshall Neilan</persName> during, say the last
                     <time>thirty or sixty days prior to <persName>Taylor's</persName>
                  death?</time></ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>Going with him?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>Had you been out anywhere with him?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>Yes; he had been to see me; I had been out with him; I am not sure whether it was
                     <time>within the thirty days</time> or not, but in <time>the last two
                     months</time>, yes sir; but going with him no more than I had for
                     <time>years</time> off and on. <persName>Mr Neilan's</persName> traits [page 9]
                  are well known; he comes to see you, and we are always glad to receive him, but we
                  never know how long he is going to stay with us or how long he was going to stay
                  with this one or that one. He flits here and there like a swallow. We are all
                  charmed with his personality, but don't take him seriously.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>Has he proposed to you?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>Must I answer that? Yes, he did.</ab>

               <ab>That would take it to <date>December 1st</date>, approximately or <date>in the
                     middle of December</date>?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>

               <ab>With reference to this <date>December 23d</date> that you called on
                     <persName>Taylor</persName>, when was it?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>

               <ab>Q. <time>Before the <date>1st of December</date></time>?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>

               <ab>Yes; about <date>the last of November</date>.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>And you, of course, rejected im, I suppose?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>Yes; that is, I didn't exactly say, <quote>"No, I will not marry you."</quote> I
                  didn't take him seriously. I joked with him at the time.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>Did he seem to be serious?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>You never know. I couldn't say whether ee was serious or not. I thought possibly
                  he was joking, or had a few <objectName>cocktails</objectName>.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN</speaker>
               <ab>How many times after that did he mention the subject to you?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>He didn't mention the subject. <quote>"May I marry you"</quote> again; he didn't
                  say that, but he has been on very friendly terms with me and then suddenly go away
                  to <placeName>San Francisco</placeName>. and I wouldn't hear from him and I would
                  remark, <quote>"Isn't that just like <persName>Marshall</persName>?"</quote> and
                  thought no more of it.</ab>
