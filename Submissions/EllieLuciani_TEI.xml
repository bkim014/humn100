               <ab>During the time in <placeName>the east</placeName> there, when he <persName>(Taylor)</persName> was directing her <persName>(Mary)</persName>, did
                  you observe any awakening of a friendship or love between the two of them?</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MRS. SHELBY:</speaker>
               <ab> No.</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>POLICE:</speaker>
               <ab>When did you first see that, or did you at all?</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MRS. SHELBY:</speaker>
               <ab>I never did know it, <persName>Mr. Keyes</persName>, until <persName>Mr. Mott</persName> told me of the <objectName>letters</objectName> that had
                  been found in <persName>Taylor's</persName> <objectName>drawer</objectName> that absolutely is convincing that there had been
                  something there.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>POLICE:</speaker>
               <ab>You mean after he was killed?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MRS. SHELBY:</speaker>
               <ab>Yes, and <persName>Mr Eyton</persName> told me also after <persName>Mr. Taylor</persName> was killed that he knew that,
                  that he knew for a long time that <persName>Mary</persName> and <persName>Mr. Taylor</persName> had been intimate, and I
                  said then <quote>"<persName>Mr. Eyton</persName> you should have told me"</quote></ab>

               <ab>During that time, <persName>Mrs. Shelby</persName> (referring to latter part of <date>1919</date> and early part of
                  <date>1920</date>), was <persName>Mary</persName> going around with <persName>Taylor</persName> to your knowledge at all?</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MRS. SHELBY:</speaker>
               <ab>Why no, and <persName>Mr. Taylor</persName> was the most perfectly poised man, such a proper man. He
                  would take <persName>Mary</persName> out to dinner and he would invariably invite me and my mother to
                  go to dinner with them.</ab>

               <ab> Not the least in the world.</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MRS. SHELBY:</speaker>
               <ab>It wasn't men. Men hadn't begun to give me any trouble at that time. It was

            <sp>
               <speaker>MRS. SHELBY:</speaker>
               <ab>No. I always felt that, when <persName>Mary</persName> was out with <persName>Mr. Taylor</persName> she was under a good
                  influence. **</ab>

               <speaker>MRS. SHELBY:</speaker>
               <ab>Never a word, never the slightest word. (Speaking of the time <persName>Mrs. Shelby</persName> went to
                  <persName>Taylor's</persName> home at <time>2 a.m.</time> looking for <persName>Mary</persName>) </ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MRS. SHELBY:</speaker>
               <ab>No, I know she didn't because there was nobody in the room but <persName>Mr. Taylor</persName> and me.
                  She stayed in the <objectName>car</objectName>.</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>POLICE:</speaker>
               <ab>You are sure you didn't have a <objectName>revolver</objectName> with you?</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MRS. SHELBY:</speaker>
               <ab>No, <persName>Mr. Keyes.</persName></ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>POLICE:</speaker>
               <ab>Well, you owned a <objectName>revolver</objectName> at that time?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MRS. SHELBY:</speaker>
               <ab> No. If I owned a <objectName>revolver</objectName> at that time, I don't know where it was. It was thrown
                  away.</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MRS. SHELBY:</speaker>
               <ab>I think I could almost fix that date, <persName>Mr. Keyes</persName>, referring to a certain little
                  <objectName>book</objectName>, you know. Because I was reading <persName>Mary's</persName> <objectName>diary</objectName> and she goes on to say in this
                  <objectName>diary</objectName> that she and I had some little words that evening, you see, and she has
                  written it very cleverly, about the small girl going out in a huff, etc., and she
                  adds that mother was right. ** And I think the date of that happening is right in
