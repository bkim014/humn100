               <ab select="statement">MINTER: She must have been 50. Her son was <persName ref='Taylor'>Mr Taylor's</persName>
                  camera man. <persName ref='Vantrees'>Jimmy</persName> was my camera man,
                     <persName ref='Vantrees'>Jim Vantrees</persName>. I don't hate the woman, but she annoys me.
                  She is one of the few people in the world I dislike to see. In fact, the irony of
                  fate it was when I was in <placeName>France</placeName> after looking at the
                  beautifUl Venus de Muile in <placeName>Paris</placeName> at the Louvre, and after
                  I had walked a few steps done a long hall, thinking of this excellent statue, who
                  should I see but <persName ref='Ivers'>Julia Crawford Ivers</persName>, a very, fat, large
                  woman. She did some more of these Christian Science things, and she had a very
                  unpleasant habit of whenever she would be with me and <persName ref='Taylor'>Mr
                     Taylor</persName>, she would always come and twit my chin. So I said, in really
                  a joking manner -- I don't want to accuse the woman, because I don't think she had
                  anything to do with the matter -- I said <quote>"I don't know anyone who would
                     kill him but <persName ref='Ivers'>Ju1ia Crawford Ivers</persName>."</quote>
                  <quote>"I always suspected the woman of being in love with him herself or she
                     might have killed him for that reason."</quote> He said, <quote>"My goodness!
                     You mustn't say that out loud; somebody will believe you."</quote> I said,
                     <quote>"I don't care if they do."</quote> I was in such a wild mood, Then, --
                  What else did we talk about? Oh! He talked about his
                     <objectName type='Film'>productions</objectName> and said, <quote>"I certainly have a
                     terrible time, working <time>day</time> and <time>night</time> and a great deal
                     depended upon <date>Saturday</date> and we must get certain work finished <time>Friday</time>."</quote> We
                  talked of <date>Friday</date>
                  <time>night</time> and that he had to get up at <time when-iso='8:00:00'>eight o'clock</time>; he
                  wasn't going to <objectName type='furniture'>bed</objectName> at all; that the boys were calling
                  for him at <time when-iso='8:00:00'>eight o'clock</time>, he said, and he knew if they didn't call he
                  would never get up out of his slumbers. They were going somewhere on
                     <placeName>location</placeName>, I understood, possibly at the
                     <placeName>studio</placeName>. He was just going <placeName>home</placeName>
                  and take a <placeName>shower</placeName>, get a shave if he felt like it, and go
                  on back and work some more. He said, <quote>"I am dog tired. I was never so
                     exhausted, just dead."</quote> Finally I said, <quote>"Do you rea1ize this
                     looks awful, being here all this time?"</quote> And he said, <quote>"I can't
                     help it if it does. I had to tell you these things and wanted to find out what
                     you knew about this case. That I know you knew <persName ref='Bill'>Bill</persName> very
                     well, probably better than any of us and"</quote> -- Oh, yes. He also asked me
                  to tel1 him my feelings toward <persName ref='Taylor'>Mr Taylor</persName>, exactly what
                  everybody has been asking me, and I told him as I have been telling you, I loved
                  him deeply, sincerely and absolutely; that I loved him truly, loved him in an
                  all-around way, I cared for his health; his health came before my happiness and
                  when he was ill -- and he didn't like to see anyone when he was ill-- my natural
                  impulse was to go to him and be with him and sit up night after night with him, if
                  necessary. l didn't do it; I didn t even attempt to, because he didn't want me to,
                  and although I had sat in the dark, not knowing anything and worrying about it, I
                  did that rather than intrude myself upon him when he didn't want me.</ab>
