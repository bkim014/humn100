               <ab>This was after the murder?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Minter</speaker>
               <ab>Yes, this was <date>Thursday night</date> after the murder. I said, <quote>"Please tell <persName>Mickey</persName> not to
                  drive that <objectName>green car</objectName> so reckless; I am so afraid that he, too, will fall into
                  trouble.</quote> And she thanked me and said, <quote>"I will tell him. That is just exactly what
                  I have been thinking lately myself, and I want to see you soon, <persName>Mary</persName>."</quote> With that I
                  thought no more about it. In fact, I didn't even think <persName>Marshall</persName> would
                  call me. He had not called me in three weeks or more. 1 thought no more about it and
                  I was surprised the next day to learn -- yes, <date>Friday</date> -- that he had tried to get
                  me at <time>five-thirty</time>. My <persName>sister</persName> was at our <placeName>old home</placeName> where there is a <objectName>telephone</objectName>. The
                  <placeName>present home</placeName> has no <objectName>telephone</objectName>, and when he happened to call there she was
                  there.</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Doran</speaker>
               <ab>At <time>five-thirty</time> of what day?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Minter</speaker>
               <ab><date>Friday</date>; and he said he was very anxious to see me. She knew I had left and was
                  driving with <persName>George Scarborough</persName>, and she said she didn't know what time I would be
                  back. He said well, he wanted me to come to see him <time>before ten o'clock</time>, but <time>after
                  ten o'clock</time> he would be on location. He didn't say the <placeName>Salt Lake Station</placeName>, but he
                  was very anxious to get hold of me <time>before ten o'clock</time>. I came in <time>after ten</time> and
                  they all told me l had better call <persName>Marshall</persName>; he seemed very anxious to get hold of
                  me. I didn't· know where to call him; I thought possibly he would come to the
                  <placeName>house</placeName>. I waited for him awhile and he didn't come, and finally <persName>grand­mother</persName> said,
                 <quote> "<persName>Dearie</persName>, If I were you I would call him up or at least call <persName>his mother</persName> and find
                  out where he is."</quote> I called the <placeName>studio</placeName> and the <persName>night watchman</persName> immediately said, <quote>"<persName>Mr
                  Neilan</persName> is not here; is this <persName>Miss Minter</persName>?"</quote> I said, <quote>"Yes."</quote> <date>Friday</date> And he said, <quote>"<persName>Mr
                  Neilan</persName> is at the <placeName>Salt Lake Station</placeName>."</quote> <persName>Mr Scarborough</persName> and l drove down there in my
                  runabout. He was very hard at work and had been <time>all night</time>, it seemed he had
                  been working <time>all night</time> tor <date>four nights past</date>. They were all just dead tired.
                  Night and day they had been working. He finished about <time>two-thirty</time>, and then there
                  were several in the party, <persName>Gloria Swanson</persName>, <persName>Jack Pickford</persName>, <persName>Frank Urson</persName> --<persName> Mr Frank
                  Urson</persName> is now associated with <persName>Mr Neilan</persName> as director -- and <persName>Marshall</persName> and myself. We
                  went to <placeName>his mother's home</placeName> where he lives with his mother and we tried to make <objectName>eggs</objectName>
                  and things. It was very amusing; we only had four <objectName>eggs</objectName>, and I tried to fry two of
                  them and ruined the things, adn we didn't have enough to go around and we made so
                  much noise his mother, who was ill upstairs, told us we must behave ourselves.
                  <persName>Marshall</persName> said, <quote>"There is only one thing to do; I have got to talk to you. We have
                  had all of this foolishness, and I have got something very important to say to
                  you, <persName>Mary</persName>. Let's drive to the <placeName>studio</placeName> where we can talk."</quote> We drove down to the
                  <placeName>Hollywood studio</placeName> and we sat there in the <placeName>office</placeName>, the <objectName>lights</objectName> burning and the
                  <persName>watchman</persName> was there and the <persName>property man</persName> was not around. He was outside. We talked
                  until dawn; it was <time>dawn</time> when we came out of the place. </ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Minter</speaker>
               <ab><persName>Marshall</persName> had tried to get for me, which was the first inkling I knew of his
                  knowledge of my <objectName>letters</objectName>, that I had written any to <persName>Mr Taylor</persName>. He told me certain
                  very, very ghastly things have since been proven absolutely true. He told
                  them to me in my interest, but they made me very furious at the time, and we left
                  more or less in a quarrel. </ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Doran</speaker>
               <ab>Will you please tell us everything that he told you there?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Minter</speaker>
               <ab>Yes, indeed. He first said,<quote> <persName>"Mary</persName>, sit down. I have something very importnat to
                  tell you."</quote> I sat down, and he said, <quote>"You know this murder of <persName>Bill</persName> is going to be
                  the greatest <date>nine-days</date> wonder"</quote> or <quote>"<date>nineteen-days</date> wonder that we have ever had,
                  certainly that <placeName>Los Angeles</placeName> ever had. You don't know what a terrible thing it is
                  going to be."</quote> I said, <quote>"Yes, I do. It is awful!"</quote> He said, <quote> "Now, <persName>Mary</persName>, I tried to
                  get your <objectName>letters</objectName>"</quote>-- </ab>
