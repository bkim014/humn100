               <ab>Well, I didn't have any more to say to him. I was just furious; I was furious
                  with him; and finally he talked and he said, more, more, more personal things
                  about, "You know Mary that I care for you." </ab>

               <ab> Yes; he did on <date when-iso= "1922-01-27"> Friday night.</date>  He said, <quote> "You know I care for you deeply."</quote>  I said,
                  <quote>"I don't care; I don't want you to care for me; I don't want John Jones to care
                  for me or anybody; I don't want ever to be in love again as long as I live; I
                  don't want to see any man; I hate men." </quote>  I probably raved on. I dont know what more
                  I can tell you. I was so tired, exhausted; I had been sitting up all night. This
                  conversation didn't come as quickly as I am te11ing it to you. It came with long
                  pauses; he would get up and walk around with his <objectName type="accessory" >cigarette</objectName> smoking and come back
                  again and go out and talk to the property man, go out of <placeName>the office</placeName>, and I would
                  sit there alone and I tore a <objectName type="miscellaneous">piece of paper</objectName>, I was so tired, and suggested that we
                  go<placeName> home</placeName>. I said, <quote> "Why keep sitting up? You have got to get up at <time when-iso= "8:30:00"> eight o'clock in
                  the morning </time>  and it is nearly dawn."</quote>  He aaid, <quote> "I am worried about this thing; I
                  want to find out what you know about this murder."</quote>  Then it developed that <persName ref="# Marshall" >Marshall</persName>
                  thought I knew something about it, and he looked at me and he said, <quote> "Now,<persName ref="#Mary"> Mary"</persName> </quote> --
                  he got a little profane, he said, <quote> "Now, <persName ref="#Mary">Mary,</persName> for God's sake, if you know anything
                  about the murder of <persName ref="#Taylor"> Bill </persName> tell it to me now."</quote>  He said, <quote> "Don't withhold anything." </quote> 
                  This was too much; not only had he been telling me these things about <persName ref= "#Taylor"> Mr Taylor,</persName>
                  but there he sat evidently believing that I knew someth1ng. I said, "Do you think
                  that I killed <persName ref= "#Taylor">Mr Taylor? </persName> " He said, <quote> "Oh, no; don't be silly. Now is no time to talk
                  things like that. "</quote> He said, <quote> "I am just trying to find something out about this.
                  This is going to be an awful affair." </quote> I said, <quote> "I didn't kill <persName ref= "#Taylor"> William Desmond
                  Taylor </persName> and I don't know who murdered him."</quote> He said, <quote> "You don't? You don't know
                  anything?" </quote>  He said, <quote> "Of course, you didn't kill him; of course, you didn't put
                  anybody on to do it, But" </quote> he said, <quote> "don't you know somebody, don't you know some
                  inti­mate details that other people might not know? Can't you rack your brain and
                  think who would have a motive for killing him?" </quote> Then he sat there and we said
                  words about pro and con, trying to think, and I thought over everyrody I knew and
                  I said this, more or less in a humourous way, I said, <quote> "The only person I know who
                  could have had a possible motive for killing him would be <persName ref="#Ivers"> Mrs. Julia Crawford 
                  Ivers."</persName> </quote> I was not serious when I said that. I was more or less humorous. She is a
                  lady I feel I ought to explain about, who has never done me a wrong thing in her
                  life and I have never done her a wrong thing, either, but she is a Christian
                  Science lady who has been associated with him as a scenario writer for many years;
                  she is quite a trusted, lovely woman, I am sure; a very honorable respectable
                  woman, but we don't like eaeh other. There is no reason, but we don't like each
                  other. Every time I wanted to see him, somehow she would be there and she had a
                  strange way of treating me. She would say, Oh yes, there is <persName ref="#Mary">little Mary.</persName> Here she
                  comes." She would go on in this manner, <quote> "Oh, there is <persName ref="#Mary">little Mary</persName> again, Oh, there
                  she is; wbat can she be want1ng this time? Oh, yes, uh huh."</quote>  Quite a strange
                  attitude, She just riled me. </ab>
